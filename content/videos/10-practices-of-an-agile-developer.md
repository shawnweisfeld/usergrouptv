Recently, off Broadway you are not only going to learn something new, you are going to have a fun time learning it! (Seriously, Caleb recently gave this talk at the Microsoft office in New York? right off Broadway) Yes friends, this is the talk that kicked off a controversy at the Dallas Tech Fest (<a href="http://developingux.com/dallastechfest2010">http://developingux.com/dallastechfest2010</a>), read the blog, see the slides.. then come see and learn for yourself!</p>
<p>Based on years of consulting, and working with some of the largest (and smallest) software companies in the world.. these are the 10 practices that if you started doing today, would drastically improve the quality and delivery of your software! Also, be sure to hang around afterwards in the Open Spaces area.. Caleb will be around to discuss any of the areas from his talk in more detail. It?s going to be great time!</p>
<p>Topics hit on: Object Oriented Principals, SOLID Coding, Security Concerns, Software Patterns, Automated Testing, Source Control - Branching and Merging Strategies, Continuous Integration, Agile | Scrum | XP | Lean, Team Dynamics, Continually Learning</p>
