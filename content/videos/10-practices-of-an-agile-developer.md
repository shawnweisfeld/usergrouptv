Also, be sure to hang around afterwards in the Open Spaces area.. Caleb will be around to discuss any of the areas from his talk in more detail. It?s going to be great time!</p>\r\n<p>Topics hit on: Object Oriented Principals, SOLID Coding, Security Concerns, Software Patterns, Automated Testing, Source Control - Branching and Merging Strategies, Continuous Integration, Agile | Scrum | XP | Lean, Team Dynamics, Continually Learning</p>\r\n<p>* Caleb was never in Europe, but it's still going to be a great session!</p>",
