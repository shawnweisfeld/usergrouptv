  "abstract": "<p>Public speaking skills can help you get your point across in any group, whether you are joining the discussion in team meetings or presenting to a large group of strangers at a conference. While some themes appear throughout advice on public speaking, like the importance of practice, speaking on technical topics to varied audiences presents an added challenge. Learning how to do so effectively gives you confidence in a variety of situations. As a former theater kid, researcher, and university instructor, it has become second-nature to me to stand in front of people and present complex information. Since becoming a developer I have realized that most people have had little to no training in public speaking. In this talk I will share what I have learned through years of speaking experience and attending talks in order to help you improve your ability to present on technical topics.</p>",
