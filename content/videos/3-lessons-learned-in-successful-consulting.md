## Speaker:

 - Mohammad Darab

## Abstract:

<p>I would like to share the 3 lessons I learned that helped me become a much better consultant. These lessons were crucial in helping me make that "mind shift" from thinking like a regular "9 to 5 DBA" to thinking like a consultant. The goal of this session is to help those who are interested in becoming a consultant. Hopefully these 3 lessons will help make that transition successful as it did for me.</p>
