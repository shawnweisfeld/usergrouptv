These lessons were crucial in helping me make that \"mind shift\" from thinking like a regular \"9 to 5 DBA\" to thinking like a consultant. The goal of this session is to help those who are interested in becoming a consultant. Hopefully these 3 lessons will help make that transition successful as it did for me.</p>",
