## Abstract:

<p>How often when creating a new table you just made the Clustered Index using an Integer column with Identity properties. Seems like that is all I have done for last many years. But, in the last two years Iâ€™ve really dove into indexes and finally with this presentation looked at what really makes a good Clustered Index with benchmarks and varying scenarios. In some scenarios a well-defined clustered index may out perform a covering non-clustered index. Results are very interesting and may surprise you.</p>
