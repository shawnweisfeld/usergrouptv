But, in the last two years I’ve really dove into indexes and finally with this presentation looked at what really makes a good Clustered Index with benchmarks and varying scenarios. In some scenarios a well-defined clustered index may out perform a covering non-clustered index. Results are very interesting and may surprise you.</p>",
