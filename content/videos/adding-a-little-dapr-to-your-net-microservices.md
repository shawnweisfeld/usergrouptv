  "abstract": "<p>Building distributed applications is not an easy thing to do. Even though there are some inherent benefits, breaking down your application into a collection of microservices comes with a completely different set of challenges. This is where DAPR can help us out. It provides a runtime and a collection of building blocks that can be used with any language, in any cloud or on-prem environment. In this session, weâ€™ll dive into DAPR, discuss the various build blocks it supports, and see some demos of how you can make use of it in your .NET applications.\r\n</p>",
