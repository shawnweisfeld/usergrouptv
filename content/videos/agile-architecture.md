So just-in-time design decisions are more agile and less wasteful than traditional upfront architecture. But unfortunately, there still are and always will be dramatic differences in skill levels of developers and their abilities to make important high-level design decisions. And while many proficient developers have adopted agile methods, wider adoption of agile processes and techniques will lead back to the division of labor that separated architects from developers to begin with. So how does architecture fit into agile processes in a way that allows agile practices to scale out across a large organization?</p>",
