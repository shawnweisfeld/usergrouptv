## Speaker:

 - Tim Costello

## Abstract:

<p>Ever wonder what should go in a fact table and what belongs in a dimension? Have a suspicion that you’re forgetting important dimensions? Wouldn't it be great if somehow your design was self-documenting? In this session I’ll give you a couple new tools and show you a new way to look at your star schema. We’ll go past ‘why’ to see ‘how’ dimensional design is a great fit with the agile principles.</p>
