Take a look under the hood of your network stack. What promises does it make? What promises can it actually keep? We have many architectural choices to make within a distributed system. Those decisions depend upon the nature of the messaging infrastructure upon which we build. Different options are good for different parts of the system. But some of the advice that you may have heard is wrong. Learn what's really happening inside of the components you choose. And use that knowledge to build more reliable distributed systems.</p>",

      "bio": "Software is math. Every class is a theorem. The compiler is the proof. And unit tests check our work. Michael wrote The Art of Immutable Architecture, a book on applying mathematics to building distributed systems. Learn more at https://immutablearchitecture.com. Michael has recorded Pluralsight courses on Distributed Systems, XAML Patterns, and Cryptography, in addition to Provable Code. Formerly a Microsoft MVP for seven years, he maintains the spoon-bending Assisticant and Jinaga open-source libraries. You can find his videos about distributed systems at historicalmodeling.com. And he helps his clients at Improving benefit from the power of software mathematics.",
