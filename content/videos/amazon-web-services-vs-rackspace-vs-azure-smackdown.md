## Abstract:

You might be tempted to think that Cloud infrastructure is a commodity once your VM image is launched. Not true. The big 3 -- actually, it's the big 1, plus 2 others -- have crucial differences that can make or break your project. This session will help you identify them.

Along with directing NWA TechFest, he also helps the NWA Startup community with Razorcloud, a non-profit effort that makes cloud infrastructure available for free to Arkansas startups.
