  "abstract": "<p>Unless you've been developing under a rock for the last year, you've no doubt heard people talking about the \"cloud.\" But, what is the cloud and how can you take full advantage of it? Microsoft's Azure cloud computing platform has made it incredibly simple for developers across a variety of platforms to build massively scalable, resilient solutions with minimal investment. In this session, Casey focuses specifically on Azure's storage capabilities including storing large, unstructured blobs of data, working with databases, relational or otherwise, and using Azure's powerful queueing mechanism. We will begin with a brief overview of the Azure platform, including general architecture and development environment setup. Next, we will take a deep dive into Azure's storage capabilities and, finally, we will wrap up the session by creating a few simple applications that demonstrate how to leverage these capabilities. Join us and learn how you can take advantage of the cloud in order to simplify the way that you build scalable applications.\r\n</p>",

Prior to joining the team, he worked closely with ISVs across the country to help build innovative solutions on the Azure, Office 365 and Windows 10 platforms. Casey considers himself a \"cloud polyglot\", holding both MCSD: Azure Solutions Architect and AWS Cloud Solutions Architect certifications. Casey is a developer at heart and, prior to joining Microsoft, consulted with companies across the country building applications of all shapes and sizes on the Microsoft platform. As an avid member of the local developer community, he enjoys presenting at conferences and user groups. Casey is also an active open source contributor and is the author of Mantle, a .NET-based cloud abstraction framework that makes it simple for organizations to build portable cloud-based applications (http://github.com/caseywatson/mantle). When not talking about, writing about or building applications for the cloud, Casey enjoys spending quality time with his beautiful wife, daughter, three cats and one giant dog in Fort Worth, TX.\r\n</p>",
