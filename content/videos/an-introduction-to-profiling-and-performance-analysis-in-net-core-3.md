  "abstract": "<p>At a high-level the talk covers debugging, profiling, and instrumenting .Net code on linux/osx using .Net Core 3 tools. In the past this wasn't quite as easy/straightforward, so I start by doing a brief historical overview of the tools and practices .Net developers had to do, then contrast them against the tools available to us now (which are so much better it's not even funny). The latter part is a dive into a few real-world example I ran into at work and in OSS projects where I used the tools to diagnose and solve issues. The repo contains the slides, as well as dockerized workable examples for attendees to try on their own.\r\n</p>",

      "bio": "<p>Chet Husk is a back-end and web developer at Binary Defense, where he works on the Managed Detection and Response product. He's been involved in the .Net ecosystem for 13 years, and has been active in the OSS community for the past 5. He's interested in operations, distributed systems, compilers, and IDE tooling, and is a major contributor to the F# ecosystem and editor tooling spaces. He's been doing this long enough to know that the real enemy is assembly resolution. A veteran of many a binding-redirects scuffle, he is passionate about clean code, functional programming, and build immutability. When he's not coding, he enjoys running with his dogs and enjoying one of the many up-and-coming breweries in North Austin.</p>",
