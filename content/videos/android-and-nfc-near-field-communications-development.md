The vast majority of my career has centered on network administration and software to identify, map, inventory, and configure network hardware. I have been president of the Tulsa Java Developers Group for the last several years and Android has seemed like a natural progression to me. Software that directly causes or observes an effect in hardware has been my hobby.</p>",
