## Abstract:

<p>Newer Android devices are coming equipped with NFC capabilities. This technology is being used to quickly share photos, contacts, and other information. It is also starting to be used for other things like payment at the cash register and location awareness. This session will provide an introduction into the Google api's surround nfc capabilities. The session will include creating a simple app that utilizes NFC for communication as well as discussing some of the possibilities and risks involved with the technology.</p>

## Bio:

 - <p>I have been developing software professionally for 16 years with 12 of that predominately in Java.. The vast majority of my career has centered on network administration and software to identify, map, inventory, and configure network hardware. I have been president of the Tulsa Java Developers Group for the last several years and Android has seemed like a natural progression to me. Software that directly causes or observes an effect in hardware has been my hobby.</p>
