## Speaker:

 - Kenneth Fisher

## Abstract:

<p>There is a steep learning curve moving from a traditional application development role into writing database code.  Your experience is telling you one thing and the DBAs are telling you another.  Making sense of what's going on can be quite a struggle.  Join me and let's try to smooth out some of the biggest points of confusion.  Including subjects like, the anatomy of a table, what's up with NULLs, why should I be cautious with functions, and how can I start tuning my queries.</p>

## Bio:

 - <p>Kenneth Fisher works as a senior database administrator for a large multinational insurance company and has over two decades of experience as a DBA. He enjoys writing and his writing credits include a number of technical articles and SQL Server related crossword puzzles. He also blogges incessantly at www.sqlstudies.com. Honored to be a Data Platform MVP.
