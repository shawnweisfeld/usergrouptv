There is a bunch of stuff in a base ASP.NET Core MVC Project that you just don?t need, and some stuff that will need to be added. We?ll walk through all of it and I?ll show you how to make the two work together to make a very slick pair. You should leave with a basic understanding of how to make these two technologies blend to make an awesome development experience!</p>",
