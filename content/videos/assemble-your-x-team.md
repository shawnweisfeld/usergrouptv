The X Team is laser-focused on engagement, recognition, and inclusion. The X Team has directly impacted the 0% team attrition rate in 2016. The X Team is powered by badass women who have a passion for making others feel like badasses too. The X Team can be summoned by the use of an emoji (that’s right, think Batman). And I can teach you how to assemble your own X Team too.</p>",
