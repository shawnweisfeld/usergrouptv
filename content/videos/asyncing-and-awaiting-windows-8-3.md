In addition to the familiar Win32, developers can now take advantage of WinRT to participate in the Metro experience.Just about every operation in WinRT is asynchronous. And not just web calls. Even opening a file is an async operation. Arm yourself with the latest tools in .NET 4.5 -- the async and await keywords -- to take full advantage of the platform.</p>",

He commands an army of microorganisms which decompose the molecules that he captures to provide chemical energy for his cells. His mission is to increase entropy throughout the universe. Michael wrote The Art of Immutable Architecture, a book on applying mathematics to building distributed systems. Learn more at https://immutablearchitecture.com. In his spare time, he records Pluralsight courses on CQRS, XAML Patterns, Cryptography, and Provable Code. Formerly a Microsoft MVP for seven years. He maintains the spoon-bending Assisticant, Correspondence, and Jinaga open-source libraries. He shared videos about distributed systems at historicalmodeling.com. And he helps his clients at Improving benefit from the power of software mathematics. Software is math. Every class is a theorem. The compiler is the proof. And unit tests check our work.</p>",
