This session will help you to understand APIM, so you can deploy your APIs and secure your services. I will start by introducing Azure API Management to those that are not so familiar with this service. Once we have a common understanding - after 10min or so - I will tell you about the early days in Vipps where we were just a couple of developers, a GIANT service and APIM. Then, we will continue on with how we used APIM to create a modular service infrastructure with APIM. We talk about policies, logging, and how we can maintain APIM.",
