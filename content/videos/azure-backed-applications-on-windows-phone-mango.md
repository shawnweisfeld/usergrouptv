Chris has worked for TEKsystems in the Dallas area as a Principal Consultant for the last 12 years working with clients such as NEC, Tyco Electronics, Justin Industries, Siemens, Ackerman McQueen and many others. His most recent project utilized MVC3 Razor, NHibernate, Spring.NET and extensive CodeSmith code generation to build a web application deeply linked into Facebook.

In his spare time, Chris is on the board of directors for 50 year old non-profit organization focused on endangered sea turtles and costal conservation around Caribbean and western Atlantic. He is currently building an Azure backed Windows Phone application that utilizes the capabilities of the phone to allow players to interact in the real world.</p>",
