## Abstract:

<p>There are a number of ways to implement your shiny new Azure resources, and we have built a pattern around one way that mirrors a traditional data center footprint.  We take Azure Quickstart Templates and wrap them in a methodology to ensure not only a consistent Azure Enrollment accounting structure but comprehensive and consistent data center deployment results.  In this session, you will learn how to properly configure your Enrollment, design and deploy a comprehensive Azure-based datacenter.</p>
