You looked at Azure SQL DB, but there are some limitations that prevent you from migrating to this service. Don't worry, you're not stranded. There is a new option designed to \"Lift and Shift\" your workload to Azure PaaS. It's a brand-new offering that just came out of private preview and into public preview. We'll discuss this new offering, its advantages, and how you can migrate with ease.</p>",
