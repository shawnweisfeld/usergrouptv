You looked at Azure SQL DB, but there are some limitations that prevent you from migrating to this service. Don't worry, you're not stranded.  There is a new option designed to \"Lift and Shift\" your workload to Azure PaaS.  It's a brand new offering that just came out of private preview and into public preview.  We'll discuss this new offering, its advantages, and how you can migrate with ease. </p>",
