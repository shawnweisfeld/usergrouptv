One of the most exciting things to be announced this year at Build was the addition of a real, native Bash and with it support for Linux command-line tools which run directly on Windows in an environment that behaves like Linux. To accomplish this, a new infrastructure was built within Windows – the Windows Subsystem for Linux (WSL) – upon which runs a genuine Ubuntu user-mode image provided by our great partners over at Canonical, creators of Ubuntu Linux.</p>",
