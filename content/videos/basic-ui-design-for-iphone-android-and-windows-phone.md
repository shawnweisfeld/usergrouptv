You may be familiar with design on one of the top platforms, but how do the other guys do it? This talk will show you how to build a very simple calculator on Android, iPhone and Windows Phone. We&rsquo;ll see the tools, the markup and the code that actually makes these apps work. We&rsquo;ll even explain the differences along the way! Finally, we&rsquo;ll talk briefly about some sites and local user groups you can get involved in to improve your mobile development skills and expand to new platforms.</p>",
