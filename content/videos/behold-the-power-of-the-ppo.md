## Speaker:

 - Kevin Hurwitz

## Abstract:

<p>Hint – this session is not about health coverage. Instead, it is about a development team role called the “Proxy Product Owner” which acts as part product owner, part architect, part business analyst, part UI/UX designer, part QA engineer, part project manager, and 100% difference-maker. Come learn about this illusive, yet critically important role. The session will cover the important aspects of this role, how it interacts with the rest of a software development team, and whether or not it is the right career path for you!
