## Speaker:

 - John Cavnar-Johnson

## Abstract:

<p>What if the secret to building good distributed applications wasn't in the latest container management technology? What if you had to connect the dots between a 1950's era fighter pilot, the social history of late medieval Europe, double entry bookkeeping, and a vast empire with no written language? No, this isn't the world weirdest conspiracy theory. Rather, humans have been building complex systems since we became human. Distributed applications are just a specialized case of complex human technology. Come find out how to apply the hard-earned knowledge of those who have gone before us and stop reinventing the wheel.</p>
