An unhappy client is telling you that they are missing something. If you acknowledge their needs and address them in a positive way, often those clients will upgrade to a plan or package that will meet their needs. It takes a lot of finesse, some humor, and compassion, but is possible with the right approach to actually use a seemingly bad situation to improve the company bottom line. </p>",
