## Speaker:

 - Michael L Perry

## Abstract:

<p>You have your choice of thousands of Flappy Bird knockoffs on any platform you want. But you can do it better than those guys! Learn how to build Flappy Bird for Android, iOS, and Windows Phone with one common C# code base using MonoGame.</p>
<p>You will learn how to maximize the code reuse across platforms. You will see how to abstract control structures to work best on the target platform. You will explore physics, game play, and graphics options to make the game as fun -- or frustrating -- as you like.</p>
<p>Bird's gonna flap. Build your app!</p>

## Bio:

 - <p>Michael travels through space clinging to the carbon hull of a spherical ship made of molten iron. He commands an army of microorganisms which decompose the molecules that he captures to provide chemical energy for his cells. His mission is to increase entropy throughout the universe. Michael wrote The Art of Immutable Architecture, a book on applying mathematics to building distributed systems. Learn more at https://immutablearchitecture.com. In his spare time, he records Pluralsight courses on CQRS, XAML Patterns, Cryptography, and Provable Code. Formerly a Microsoft MVP for seven years. He maintains the spoon-bending Assisticant, Correspondence, and Jinaga open-source libraries. He shared videos about distributed systems at historicalmodeling.com. And he helps his clients at Improving benefit from the power of software mathematics. Software is math. Every class is a theorem. The compiler is the proof. And unit tests check our work.</p>
