## Abstract:

<p>
When you build cross-device applications you want to build it once, have it work across all devices and deliver the best user experience. With Windows 8 and Windows Phone 8, the WinRT kernel means that building across devices has never been easier. There are 2 important concepts we need to embrace in order to build the best cross-device applications. We will give you best practices for sharing code, focusing on portable class libraries. Then weâ€™ll show you how to optimize the interfaces to most appropriately target your app for the best user experience while leveraging that shared code.
