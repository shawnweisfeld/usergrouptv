If this sounds like you, you owe it to yourself to attend this session and get a foundational understanding of what exactly Windows Azure is and how you can leverage it in powerful ways in your new and existing .NET applications. In this session, Casey starts by covering some basic, high-level cloud-related topics to give you a solid foundation in cloud development, then moves on to how Windows Azure implements these ideas and makes them easily consumable to .NET developers. Finally, you will have the opportunity to dive in with Casey and build applications from scratch that leverage several important Azure features such as Azure storage and service bus. Bring your questions about Windows Azure to this highly interactive session.\r\n</p>",

      "bio": "<p>As a Senior Program Manager with the Azure Customer Advisory Team (AzureCAT) at Microsoft, Casey is dedicated to educating and partnering with GSIs to help build world-class Azure practices. Prior to joining the team, he worked closely with ISVs across the country to help build innovative solutions on the Azure, Office 365 and Windows 10 platforms. Casey considers himself a \"cloud polyglot\", holding both MCSD: Azure Solutions Architect and AWS Cloud Solutions Architect certifications. Casey is a developer at heart and, prior to joining Microsoft, consulted with companies across the country building applications of all shapes and sizes on the Microsoft platform. As an avid member of the local developer community, he enjoys presenting at conferences and user groups. Casey is also an active open source contributor and is the author of Mantle, a .NET-based cloud abstraction framework that makes it simple for organizations to build portable cloud-based applications (http://github.com/caseywatson/mantle). When not talking about, writing about or building applications for the cloud, Casey enjoys spending quality time with his beautiful wife, daughter, three cats and one giant dog in Fort Worth, TX.\r\n</p>",
