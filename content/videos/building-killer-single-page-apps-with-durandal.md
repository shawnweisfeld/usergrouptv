  "abstract": "<p>JavaScript has come into its own as a language for building large, rich applications. Browser improvements have made it lightning-fast and a healthy ecosystem of libraries has risen up around it. Still, building Single-Page applications on your own can be a daunting task. That's where Durandal comes in. It leverages existing libraries like Knockout and RequireJS for data-binding and dependency management, and layers on additional features needed by real-world applications like compositional UI. Come see how Durandal can help you create web applications using state-of-the-art practices and tooling.\r\n</p>",

      "bio": "<p>Brian Sullivan is a principal software engineer at Clear Measure in Dallas. He got his start in programming maintaining legacy mainframe applications in COBOL at a large trucking company, but quickly realized he needed to find a more productive environment in order to stay sane. He jumped at the opportunity to help transition some of those COBOL applications to .NET, and he hasnâ€™t looked back since. He has been working with Microsoft technologies since the .NET 1.0 days, and is interested in introducing modern web development techniques to the clients he works with. Brian is recipient of the Microsoft MVP award in ASP.NET and a graduate of Harding University.</p>",
