## Abstract:

<p>These days, the SPA framework space is crowded. Aurelia stands out from its contemporaries in a few important ways. Creating components using vanilla Javascript classes, leveraging convention to minimize development overhead, and future-proofing for upcoming technologies like Web Components are just a few of the advantages Aurelia offers. Come see how you can easily use Aurelia to create great single-page apps backed by the latest ASP.NET backend. We'll cover data binding, templating, dependency injection, custom HTML elements, and more.</p>

## Bio:

 - <p>Brian Sullivan is a principal software engineer at Clear Measure in Dallas. He got his start in programming maintaining legacy mainframe applications in COBOL at a large trucking company, but quickly realized he needed to find a more productive environment in order to stay sane. He jumped at the opportunity to help transition some of those COBOL applications to .NET, and he hasnâ€™t looked back since. He has been working with Microsoft technologies since the .NET 1.0 days, and is interested in introducing modern web development techniques to the clients he works with. Brian is recipient of the Microsoft MVP award in ASP.NET and a graduate of Harding University.</p>
