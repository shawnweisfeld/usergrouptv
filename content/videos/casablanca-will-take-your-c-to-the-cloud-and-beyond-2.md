  "abstract": "<p>C++ was designed to combine portability, speed, and light weight abstractions.  These traits have lead to C++ being the language of choice when performance, reliability, and control are required.  Casablanca is a new set of libraries from Microsoft which amongst other things brings Modern C++ to the Cloud as a first class player.  Additionally, Casablanca makes a great set of libraries to perform network communications within any network, not just the cloud.  In line with Microsoft's initiative to contribute proposals to the C++ standard libraries, Casablanca is written for Modern C++, and thus provides clean and safe libraries to write high performance reliable network applications.  The presentation will begin with an overview of Casablanca with a special focus on Casablanca's implementation the Erlang actor system. Then we will proceed to build a working Casablanca client and server application to see it the libraries in action.</p>",
