  "bio": "<p>I have been developing software professionally for 16 years with 12 of that predominately in Java.. The vast majority of my career has centered on network administration and software to identify, map, inventory, and configure network hardware. I have been president of the Tulsa Java Developers Group for the last several years and Android has seemed like a natural progression to me. Software that directly causes or observes an effect in hardware has been my hobby.</p>",
