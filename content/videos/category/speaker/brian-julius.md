  "bio": "Brian holds a B.A. in Economics and a M.S. in Public Policy and Management, both heavily focused on econometrics and other quantitative methods. After beginning his career in economic consulting, he worked 30+ years for the U.S. Federal government, in a variety of data-driven roles, as well as in a number of executive/senior management positions. Since 2019, he has focused primarily on Power BI development, implementation and training, first serving as Project Manager on his agency's first large-scale implementation of Power BI. After retiring from the government in 2021, he began working full-time as the Enterprise DNA Chief Content Officer overseeing the creation of all free and member-only technical content, and continuing to serve as an expert and content creator myself. Brian lives in Washington, DC with my wife Sue and two charming, but ill-behaved cats who often can be seen and heard interrupting his YouTube videos.",
