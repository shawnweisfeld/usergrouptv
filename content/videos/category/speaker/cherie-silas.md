  "bio": "<p>Cherie Silas Agile Coach, Principal Consultant Improving Enterprises I am a business professional who has been leading, coaching, training, and mentoring people for many years. I have a strong desire to help people arrive at the place they define as success in both personal and professional life. My goal is to invest the experience and talents I have gathered through years of learning, often times the hard way, into people whom I hope will become greater than I can ever dream to be. I believe in servant leadership which is all about finding joy in setting your personal aspirations aside and giving people what they need to grow and experience success. Ultimately, watching people accomplish things that they never believed possible and seeing them become who they never believed they could be fulfills every need I have for success in my life. Professional Certifications: Professional Scrum Master, Certified Scrum Master, Professional Scrum Product Owner, Certified Scrum Professional, Project Management Professional </p>",
