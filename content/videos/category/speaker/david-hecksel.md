  "bio": "David Hecksel is a Principal Data Integration Architect at Oracle. Residing in Dallas Texas, David joined Oracle in 2006 as a pre-sales Architect for Oracle Fusion Middleware. Six months after joining, David volunteered to add pre-sales coverage for a recently acquired product called Oracle Data Integrator and the rest (including the writing of this book) has been a labor of love working with a platform and solution that simultaneously provides phenomenal user productivity and system performance gains to the traditionally separate IT career realms of Data Warehousing, Service Oriented Architects, and Business Intelligence developers. Before joining Oracle, David spent six years with Sun Microsystems in their Sun Java Center, was CTO for 4 years at Axtive Software architecting and developing several one-to-one marketing and web personalization platforms such as e.Monogram. In 1997, David also invented, architected, developed, and marketed online the award-winning JCertify product - the industry's first electronic delivery of study content and exam simulation for the Certified Java Programmer exam. Prior to Axtive Software, David was with IBM for 12 years as a software developer working on operating system, storage management, and networking software products. David holds a BS Computer Science degree from the University of Wisconsin-Madison and a Masters of Business Administration from Duke University.",
