  "bio": "<p>I'm Deanna, an Entrepreneur and Product Owner from Nashville, Tennessee. What I enjoy most is working with others in the tech community to increase harmony among my peers. I am on boards and organizing teams for several tech events/organizations in Nashville including Music City Code, Nodevember and WomenGetIT. I also created an app idea called Doo Drop which is a mobile app geared to get people outside, be active and spend quality time with their dogs. I'm learning to code so I can work on Doo Drop and a few other app concepts of mine. I had a fear of public speaking so I started learning to sing and play guitar as a fun way to overcome my fear. </p>",
