  "bio": "Gary McCants is a Principal Consultant with Improving Enterprises Agile Practice. He entered the craft in 1986 and has played roles from Analyst Programmer to educator to CIO. Gary’s passion is centered in forming and nurturing high-performance teams, and he has found agile methods to be the perfect companion. Being an old fogey, he is witnessing the pendulum swinging back to the simpler, common-sense methods that prevailed when our industry was newer and it was fun to solve our friends’ problems with shiny new technology. His appreciation for technical excellence and higher thinking formed during his time at ObjectSpace, where he met the founders of Improving and many of the other speakers at this conference. Gary is a Certified Scrum Master about to turn Certified Scrum Practitioner and possesses strength in product, project, requirements, and testing management.\r\n\r\nKim Fisher is the Chief Information Officer for American Fidelity Assurance Co., headquartered in Oklahoma City. Kim was appointed to the CIO role in April of 2009, and has been with the company for 22 years. Prior to becoming CIO, Kim served in a variety of positions including Director of Applications Development and Director of the Project Development Office.\r\n\r\nUpon receiving her Bachelor of Science degree in Child Development/Social Services from the University of Maine at Orono, Kim veered from her course and headed for the technology field. Starting out as a Business Systems Analyst for the Metropolitan Life Insurance Company in New York City, she quickly became intrigued with the human side of technology adaptation.\r\n\r\nSince that time - both as a developer and a manager - Kim has learned that the best business technology solutions for an organization cannot provide desired value in the absence of inspired teams, solid processes and Executive support. Agile (Scrum) is providing American Fidelity a better means to achieve their goals, and bridge IT and the business in new and motivational ways.\r\n\r\nJay Spears is the Director of Enterprise Development at KPMG LLP.
