  "bio": "Gary McCants is a Principal Consultant with Improving Enterprises Agile Practice. He entered the craft in 1986 and has played roles from Analyst Programmer to educator to CIO. Gary’s passion is centered in forming and nurturing high-performance teams, and he has found agile methods to be the perfect companion. Being an old fogey, he is witnessing the pendulum swinging back to the simpler, common-sense methods that prevailed when our industry was newer and it was fun to solve our friends’ problems with shiny new technology. His appreciation for technical excellence and higher thinking formed during his time at ObjectSpace, where he met the founders of Improving and many of the other speakers at this conference. Gary is a Certified Scrum Master about to turn Certified Scrum Practitioner and possesses strength in product, project, requirements, and testing management.",
