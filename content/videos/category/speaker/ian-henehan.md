  "bio": "Ian Henehan is a Senior Consultant at Improving Enterprises. He got his start doing electrical and control design for LCD manufacturing machines. He eventually joined the Intel Architecture Labs as an integration and test engineer, building a wide array of specialized test equipment and software. This experience led to an interest in team process and how to minimize the friction it can create for producing results. A three year stint with the Educational Technology group at Texas Instruments allowed him to concentrate on test frameworks and integration with build systems. This resulted in a broader understanding of the problem space that available frameworks tried to solve and also building a couple new tool sets from scratch. Since joining Improving, he has had the opportunity to continue work in this area and gets to design  tools for highly integrated build, test and deployment solutions.",
