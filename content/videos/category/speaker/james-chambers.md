Now a four-time Microsoft MVP in ASP.NET/IIS, he shares his programming experiences and knowledge with kids aged 9-14 through local school division programs.\r\n</p>\r\n<p>His background includes projects in energy companies, telecommunications, sports entertainment, transportation, and more. He has lead development teams in web & cloud-enabled applications as well as mobile and stand-alone desktop apps.\r\n</p>\r\n<p>In addition to spending time with his family, you can find James hammering away at his blog at www.jameschambers.com or volunteering with local and national charities to help fight poverty and Type 1 Diabetes. When that’s not the case, he’s likely digging in the secret tunnels of the Canadian Prairies, writing articles on MSDN or occasionally appearing on Microsoft Virtual Academy as a presenter or community SME.\r\n</p>",
