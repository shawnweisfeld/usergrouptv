  "bio": "<p>Jason grew up in small-town Oklahoma and studied computer science in college. Like many of us, he entered into the programming workforce without a good understanding of his craft or that it even WAS a craft. He had no idea how a software developer should work on a team. Then, he learned about Scrum and Agile developmentâ€¦and he was hooked. Jason supports his wife and 3 kids by burning a lamp wick soaked with the values and principles of the Agile Manifesto. He brings home bacon cured with a mix of the Scrum values artifacts, events, and roles. He lives and breathes this stuff.\r\n</p>",
