  "bio": "John Lockwood began this year with a resolution to learn and use map/reduce to process big Data and extract useful information from it. In fact he brought in the new year reading mongoDB map/reduce documentation. Along with his regular duties developing for the web using cloud services and noSQL datastores he continued to work and learn big Data wrangling techniques, performing many iterations of map/reduces to find cool and useful information. Now it's time to spread some insights and techniques.",
