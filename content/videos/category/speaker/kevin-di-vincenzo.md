  "bio": "<p>Kevin Di Vincenzo is a self-taught software engineer, consultant, and technology enthusiast. He first started learning about writing code in the 7th grade with ‘QuickBasic’ and ‘C’. Although his formal education was in Physics and Applied Mathematics, he has dabbled in many facets of information technology – from databases, NoSQL/BigData, and dev-ops to message/event based systems, distributed computing, and language design. His “go-to” languages are ‘C#’ and ‘Scala’.</p>\r\n<p>He is Functional Programming advocate, an Agile proponent (specifically ‘Extreme Programming’), and follows Erik Meijer and Marc Gravell (among others). He has worked for companies such as Samsung Electronics, General Electric, and Kent State University.</p>\r\n<p>When he is not working on the ‘Fireball’ programming language or consulting, Kevin enjoys learning new technologies, reading science fiction, traveling, Unity3D, video games, and contemplating going back to school for his Ph.D. in Plasma Physics.</p>",
