  "bio": "Kim Fisher is the Chief Information Officer for American Fidelity Assurance Co., headquartered in Oklahoma City. Kim was appointed to the CIO role in April of 2009, and has been with the company for 22 years. Prior to becoming CIO, Kim served in a variety of positions including Director of Applications Development and Director of the Project Development Office.\r\n\r\nUpon receiving her Bachelor of Science degree in Child Development/Social Services from the University of Maine at Orono, Kim veered from her course and headed for the technology field. Starting out as a Business Systems Analyst for the Metropolitan Life Insurance Company in New York City, she quickly became intrigued with the human side of technology adaptation.\r\n\r\nSince that time - both as a developer and a manager - Kim has learned that the best business technology solutions for an organization cannot provide desired value in the absence of inspired teams, solid processes and Executive support. Agile (Scrum) is providing American Fidelity a better means to achieve their goals, and bridge IT and the business in new and motivational ways.",
