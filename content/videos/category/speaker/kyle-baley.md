  "bio": "<p>Known throughout the land as The Coding Hillbilly, Kyle’s career choices have hinged on a single criterion: to have fun. Luckily, he finds software development fun! (as opposed to, say, shark taunting). His travels have taken him from the jungles of the financial industry to the high-flying hospitality industry to the bowels of the telecommunications industry (which he refers to as his “goth phase”).\r\n</p>\r\n<p>He has spoken at various conferences and user groups and co-written a book, Brownfield Application Development in .NET, with fellow Clear Measurite (Clear Measurian? Clear Measurer?) Donald Belcham, an experience that required some stretching of the definition of “fun”. He is also a member of ASP Insiders.\r\n</p>\r\n<p>In his downtime, Kyle is a classically-trained pianist who uses his training to play things like “Theme from The Muppet Show”, usually to the chagrin of the other musicians of the band he’s in. Canadian by birth, he and his wife and two children currently make their home in the Bahamas though, truth be told, he’s never really liked long walks on the beach. He does, however, enjoy writing bios about himself.\r\n</p>",
