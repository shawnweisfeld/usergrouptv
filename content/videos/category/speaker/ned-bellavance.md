  "bio": "<p>I’m an IT professional with almost 20 years of experience in the field. I’ve been a helpdesk operator, systems administrator, cloud architect, and product manager. In my newest incarnation I am the Founder of Ned in the Cloud LLC. As a one-man-tech-juggernaut, I develop courses for Pluralsight, run a podcast for Packet Pushers, run a podcast for myself, and create original content for technology vendors. I’ve been a Microsoft MVP since 2017 and I hold a bunch of industry certifications that have no bearing on anything beyond my exceptional ability to take exams and pass them.
