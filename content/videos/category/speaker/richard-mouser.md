  "bio": "<p>Richard Mouser is a Consultant with Improving Enterprises. Richard has been working on software projects for over 30 years in numerous roles including developer, Dev Lead, QA lead, manager, Scrum Master, and Product Owner.\r\n\r\nRichard has always been curious about what makes one team hum along productively, while another team of similar talent struggles. Following this interest has led him to explore diverse subjects such as neurobiology, evolutionary psychology, marketing, and everything about people.\r\n\r\nWhen heâ€™s not pursuing the human aspects of software development, Richard enjoys a variety of outdoor activities, including biking, hiking, snow skiing, and water sports.</p>",
