  "bio": "Rik Hepworth Chief Consulting Office, Black Marble; Microsoft MVP (Azure); Microsoft Regional Director As Chief Consulting Officer at Black Marble, Rik helps organisations large and small use Cloud better. Whether that is a new adoption where governance and management are key, or an application modernisation project where technology choice and team knowledge are important factors in success. Through his public speaking and community involvement, Rik is a recipient of the Microsoft MVP Programme award for his work with Azure. He is also proud to be a member of the Microsoft Regional Director Programme. As an event organiser, speaker and lapsed blogger, Rik is keen to share his knowledge with the community, and encourage and support others as they do the same. His grey hair is an indication of how long he has worked in IT, and in that time he's done most things you'd expect of an IT Pro: From crawling under floors pulling cables, to managing large scale automated OS rollouts, to architecting solutions for on-premises and cloud. Now he spends more time working with his customers' management, sharing that breadth of experience and learning.",
