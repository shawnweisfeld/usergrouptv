  "bio": "<p>Robert is the son of SQLFamily Members Lance and Angela Tidwell. He has been very interested in being an active member of the SQLFamily and has always been ready to lend a hand at SQL Saturdays by directing traffic, taking selfies, and helping speakers and attendees find rooms and snacks.  Robert is a fun 8 year old with a passion for video games, telling a great story, and making people smile. Seeing both of his parents enjoy sharing their stories through speaking engagements, he has decided to create his own presentations to share his unique experiences and views.\r\n</p>",
