  "bio": "<p>As an ICAgile Certified Professional and Certified ScrumMaster with nearly 10 years of software development experience with Microsoft technologies, I have learned a breadth of development technologies for desktop (WinForms, WPF, UWA, and UWP), web (WebForms, MVC, AngularJs, and Angular 2), and mobile (Windows CE, Windows Mobile, Windows Phone 7/8/8.1, and Xamarin). Since I first made the turtle dance around the screen using Logo, I have had a passion for development and am fortunate I get to do what I love for a living.</p>",
