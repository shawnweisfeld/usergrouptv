  "bio": "<p>Sara Ford decided to take a year off to try academia, because hey, it's just a 1-year contract, \"What's the worst that can happen?\" Sara is teaching software engineering at Cal Poly in San Luis Obispo. She is a former employee of Microsoft and GitHub and is a Distinguished Engineering Fellow at Mississippi State University. It's quite likely that Sara is the only person in the world to help start an open source project hosting site (CodePlex) at one company and help shut it down at another company (GitHub). She received her Masters degree in UX / Human Factors at San Jose State University to focus on improving the usability in developer tools. She is the author of two books on Visual Studio and has delivered numerous talks all over the world on programming technologies. Her life-long dream is to be a 97-year old weightlifter, so she can be featured on the local news.</p>",
