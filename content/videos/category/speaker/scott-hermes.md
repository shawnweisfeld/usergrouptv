  "bio": "Scott Hermes has been working in the software business for over 35 years. He began his tech career by manually moving 0's and 1's with a very tiny pair of tweezers until it was brought to his attention that programming languages exist to make things like that much easier. From his first paying job where he worked in dBase and WordStar to his current gig where he architects solutions in Azure, Scott has played many roles in the tech pantheon of characters and worked with many different technologies. He is also the host of an award-winning Innovation podcast, Look Both Ways (https://lookbothways.kinandcarta.com/).",
