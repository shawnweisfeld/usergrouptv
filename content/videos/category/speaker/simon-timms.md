  "bio": "Simon is a polyglot developer who has worked on everything from serial port drivers on an Android tablet, to NServiceBus, to processing tens of thousands of messages a second using stream analytics, to building Angular web applications. All that in the last year. He is the author of a number of books on JavaScript and ASP.NET and blogs far less regularly than he should on both the Western Devs site (https://www.westerndevs.com/) and on his blog (https://blog.simontimms.com/). He is also the least visible member of the ASP.NET monsters (https://aspnetmonsters.com/).",
