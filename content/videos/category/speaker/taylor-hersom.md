  "bio": "<p>Adam and Taylor are both graduates of the University of Montana where they were both members of the Management Information Systems Association (MISA) student group. Taylor, whoâ€™s path took him to Deloitte and now CISO at RSI and Adam, who is currently working closely with Microsoft to present on security and compliance met up 6 years later in Austin, TX. After eating some greasy (and great) pizza, the 6 year catch up turned into an in depth discussion about cyber\r\nsecurity, compliance, and value-selling. When the opportunity arose to co-present on cyber security, it was a no-brainier, they jumped on the opportunity. Go Griz!</p>",
