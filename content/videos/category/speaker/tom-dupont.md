  "bio": "<p>Tom DuPont (<a href=\"http://www.codesmithtools.com\">http://www.codesmithtools.com</a>, <a href=\"http://tomdupont.net\">http://tomdupont.net</a>) lives in Dallas, Texas, where he is the Vice President of CodeSmith Tools, LLC. But don&rsquo;t let the title fool you, Tom is a total code monkey! He specializes in .NET development with C#, ASP.NET MVC, and even that crazy JavaScript stuff. Tom has a bachelor's degree in Computer Science and Software Engineering from the University of Texas at Dallas. In his spare time Tom enjoys long rides across the country on his motorcycle.</p>",
