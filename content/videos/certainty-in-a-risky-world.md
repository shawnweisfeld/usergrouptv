## Abstract:

<p>Have you ever noticed that releases of software at your organization directly correlate to problems and issues that arise as new code begins powering your site or application? Have you had difficulty quantifying and communicating this risk to your organization at large? Do some of your releases include multiple development teams and large, cross-functional programs? In this presentation, we'll cover some useful metrics for releases for both large and small development efforts. These metrics include number of defects, unit test coverage, and passing test cases. We'll also demonstrate how these can be pulled together into a single dashboard, as well as one single rating, in order to best communicate whether or not a release or large program effort is ready. The specific tools that will be used for the demo are Atlassian's Confluence and JIRA, along with Zephyr (for test case management). However, the concepts that we'll discuss should broadly apply to other tools that may be used. Armed with what you learn in the presentation, you can bring more certainty into your projects!</p>
