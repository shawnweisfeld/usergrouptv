  "abstract": "<p>Ever wonder where your auditors come up with the security settings they look for in your environment? One of their sources is the CIS (Center for Internet Security) Security Benchmarks. This session will introduce you to the current CIS SQL Server Security Benchmarks and the recommendations they contain. Then, I’ll show you an easy way to setup your own validation checks using SQL Server’s Policy Based Management feature. Lastly, you’ll learn how you can be part of the CIS Community input. So, bring your current security setting checklist to see if you’ve missed anything or to propose changes in future CIS Security Benchmarks. </p>",
