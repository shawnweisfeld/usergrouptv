## Abstract:

<p>SQL Server has many performance WOMs (Word of Mouth), especially concerning indexes to include: keep clustered index width small, unique indexes perform better, keep non-clustered index width small, compressed indexes have fewer logical reads. This session dives down and looks at important items within index pages of clustered, non-clustered, and unique non-clustered indexes using the DBCC Page command to factually document index WOMs.  The effect of row data compression on clustered and non-clustered indexes are also investigated.  The demos will ascertain how the SQL Server optimizer might use them and strive to gain some insight from a performance advantage. The session is 80% demos. This presentation will propel the layman to a new level of index understanding. Performance! That’s what we are all looking for. Blast off with this presentation.</p>
