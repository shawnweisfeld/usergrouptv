  "abstract": "<p>IT people and the businesses they serve have long suffered from a chasm of misunderstanding, mistrust, and a fundamental lack of ability to relate. Agile management methods give us tools to align IT projects with what our users say they want. But that brings dangers of building &ldquo;nice to haves&rdquo; instead of what&rsquo;s really needed. So how do we have a meeting of the minds on what&rsquo;s really important? And how do we share a vision for what&rsquo;s technically possible? How do we make IT a business partner instead of a service bureau that&rsquo;s scary to work with? In this talk we explore underlying issues that cause the IT/business divide, ways we can communicate better and work more closely, and paint a vision of a Business/IT partnership that can change ourselves, our companies, and the world for the better.</p>",
