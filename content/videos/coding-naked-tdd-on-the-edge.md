## Abstract:

<p>Automated Unit Tests are your first line of defense to reducing technical debt, increasing code quality and efficiency. Come learn why TDD is not a fancy practice for the coding elite, but an understandable, obtainable and practical approach to delivering value for every developer, and how, when done properly, will increase communication and design between the business stake holders and developers. Come learn practical approaches to Test Driven Development and BDD from the author of Automated Unit Tests in the Wrox Book "Real World .NET, C# and Silverlight - Indispensable Experience from 15 MVPs Learning objectives: • Distinguish between the 4 major elements of automated unit tests. Code, Tests, Testing Framework and Test Runners and how they interact with each other to round out your engineering practices. • Discover how Mocking Frameworks and DI make your tests easier to read and write in everyday life. • Dig in to better ways to write and organize your tests so that they communicate intent, document your code for you and bridge the gap between development and business needs.
