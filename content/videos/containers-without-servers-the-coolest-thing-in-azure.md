  "abstract": "<p>Containers are one of the hottest topics. You can ship stuff in them! But then what?\r\nWell, build a server or create a VM that can run your container. What?!? Oh yea, then pick an\r\norchestrator to care and feed your instances. Wouldn’t it be great if you could just run it? Come\r\nfind out how!\r\nA Container is a fascinating technology that in essence virtualizes your application stack\r\ninstead of having to virtualize your entire Operation Systems. It’s one of the most interesting\r\napplication packaging technologies currently in use. What gets difficult is that after you have\r\nyour web site, web service, batch/cron/windows service all packaged up, you need some place\r\nto run it. There are some great options such as Kubernetes, Docker, RedHat OpenShift, Pivotal\r\nCloud Foundry, Azure App Services, Azure Service Fabric, etc… All of those take some kind of\r\nsetup, and most require extensive knowledge to prepare and then deploy to.\r\nAzure Container Instances (ACI), the PaaS hosting offering exclusively in Azure, allows\r\nusers to simply run a container. That means, no setting up servers, no settings up an\r\norchestrator, just ask Azure to run your Container. During this talk, we will do a simple overview\r\nof Containers, talk about ACI, then demonstrate containerizing a Node JS web application, and\r\nhave it running in Azure thru a DevOps pipeline.</p>",
