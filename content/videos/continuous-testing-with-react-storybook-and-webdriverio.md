  "abstract": "<p>Working in a continuous testing environment requires us to think on multiple levels about how we test our code. We have our core component library which we can sandbox and experiment with in React Storybook. We can test our components thoroughly here in *multiple browsers* to check compatibility and function. Then we assemble our components in a react app, where we implement another level of unit and functional testing. Our react app has very specific goals, which we can acceptance test through WebdriverIO (Selenium). All of this can run in the background *and* on a continuous integration server as part of our build process so we can continually iterate on our code without fear of introducing breaking changes. This tight feedback loop is key for pursuing continuous deployment and rapid delivery of code and allows us to go further with greater confidence than before. In this talk, we will walk through some tooling and explore examples of how you can implement continuous testing in your delivery lifecycle using thing like React, Redux, Storybook, Mocha, Jest, WebdriverIO, Selenium, and GO CI.</p>",

When he took the leap into automated testing, he never looked back and has continued to apply testing principles across the whole delivery process. Josh is an avid cyclist and often commutes to work on his beloved Bianchi road bike. In his off hours, he enjoys spending time with his wife, Rachel, and his dog, Alistair. He is a board & video game enthusiast, woodworker, and an excellent campfire cook.</p>",
