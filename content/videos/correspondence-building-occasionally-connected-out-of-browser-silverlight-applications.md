## Abstract:

<p>Silverlight is not just a browser plug-in. It is a platform for delivering rich desktop applications. When used out-of-browser, it has access to isolated storage and the ability to run off-line. Correspondence helps you take advantage of these features. Correspondence automatically synchronizes your application's local data with other users and other devices. When you design your data model using its DSL, it generates both a local database and a network protocol. Then it gives you an object model to code against that seamlessly bridges local and remote. I'll walk you through the development of a collaborative application, Thought Cloud. We'll cover the following topics: The Facutal modeling language, The Community, The view model layer, Publish/subscribe communications, Good Silverlight citizenship (asynchronous behavior, network status, quota elevation).</p>

 - <p>Michael travels through space clinging to the carbon hull of a spherical ship made of molten iron. He commands an army of microorganisms which decompose the molecules that he captures to provide chemical energy for his cells. His mission is to increase entropy throughout the universe. Michael wrote The Art of Immutable Architecture, a book on applying mathematics to building distributed systems. Learn more at https://immutablearchitecture.com. In his spare time, he records Pluralsight courses on CQRS, XAML Patterns, Cryptography, and Provable Code. Formerly a Microsoft MVP for seven years. He maintains the spoon-bending Assisticant, Correspondence, and Jinaga open-source libraries. He shared videos about distributed systems at historicalmodeling.com. And he helps his clients at Improving benefit from the power of software mathematics. Software is math. Every class is a theorem. The compiler is the proof. And unit tests check our work.</p>
