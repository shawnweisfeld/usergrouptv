For the business to be agile, each of these services needs to be responsive to its own internal customer base. And for business continuity, each one also needs to be physically and logically isolated from one another. Inter-dependencies among services hurts performance, scalability, responsiveness, and agility. CQRS is a separation pattern that addresses these concerns. It is based on the theory of distributed systems (the CAP Theorem), and on the practice of Domain Driven Design. Discover the patterns, practices, and tools for building responsive enterprise solutions.</p>",

He commands an army of microorganisms which decompose the molecules that he captures to provide chemical energy for his cells. His mission is to increase entropy throughout the universe. Michael wrote The Art of Immutable Architecture, a book on applying mathematics to building distributed systems. Learn more at https://immutablearchitecture.com. In his spare time, he records Pluralsight courses on CQRS, XAML Patterns, Cryptography, and Provable Code. Formerly a Microsoft MVP for seven years. He maintains the spoon-bending Assisticant, Correspondence, and Jinaga open-source libraries. He shared videos about distributed systems at historicalmodeling.com. And he helps his clients at Improving benefit from the power of software mathematics. Software is math. Every class is a theorem. The compiler is the proof. And unit tests check our work.</p>",
