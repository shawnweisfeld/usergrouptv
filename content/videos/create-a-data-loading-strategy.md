  "abstract": "<p>Loading large amounts of data into SQL Server can be challenging. Many factors may challenge your goal for tuned performance. To make the decision making process more difficult, many of the choices listed below have both Pros and Cons to their implementation. For this reason, loading large amounts of data requires a strategy. Create a strategy to optimize your massive data loading processes: 1) High Performance Data Loading (SCD Type II and Type I using checksums) 2) Minimal Logging and Bulk Loading 3) Indexing Considerations 4) Delayed Durability 5) Eager Write. This session uses a Virtual Sandbox to demonstrate “real” data loads using these techniques listed above. We will look at the T-SQL used in these data loads. We will briefly discuss how the different settings and configurations effect the data loads. Power Point slides and sample SQL will be provided.</p>",
