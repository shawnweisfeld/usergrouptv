## Abstract:

<p>Using SharePoing Designer 2010 and its out-of-the-box workflow features, we'll cobble together a real-world solution. This solution will use SharePoint 2010, customized InfoPath forms and SharePoint Designer workflows to unleash the power of SharePoint to the beginner or intermediate business user.</p>

## Bio:

 - <p>Russell introduced SharePoint to Texas Instruments in 2002 while heading a systems group in the Worldwide Procurement and Logistics area. His team assisted internal users with obtaining significant business value from Windows SharePoint Services and other Microsoft technologies for several years. He continues to help people plan and architect business solutions using SharePoint. When he&rsquo;s not SharePoint-ing, you can find him at the bowling alley.</p>
