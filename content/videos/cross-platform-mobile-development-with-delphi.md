## Speaker:

 - Jon Robertson

## Abstract:

<p>With Delphi XE 6, you can develop an application that can run on Windows, Mac OS X, iOS, and Android. All from a single IDE. In this session, I'll give an introduction to using Delphi XE 6 to do just that. For each platform, I'll demonstrate how to build, deploy, and debug a sample application.</p>

## Bio:

 - <p>As a software developer using Delphi since 1996, Jon has earned three Delphi certifications and has presented at three Delphi conferences. He has also contributed to multiple commercial software products, partially through his work at MedEvolve, an ISV developing healthcare software, for the last fourteen years.</p>
<p>Jon is a DJ at heart and can almost always be found with music playing as his background noise. He is very excited about exploring new mobile development opportunities using Delphi.</p>

## Recorded At:
