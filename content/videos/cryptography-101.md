## Speaker:

 - Nolan Egly

## Abstract:

<p>Information sharing may be great for your team, but not so great when it comes to your valuable, sensitive data. This talk is an introduction to cryptography - the art and science of keeping information secret. We'll gently introduce core concepts like steganography, codes, ciphers, and lexical analysis by reviewing the history of making (and breaking) secret writing systems from ancient times to World War 2, and finish with a discussion about modern symmetric and asymmetric (aka public key) encryption.</p>

## Bio:

 - <p>Nolan Egly has been developing software professionally for almost ten years and 'unprofessionally' since he was eight years old. He's still as excited about the possibilities of technology today as he was as a child, and loves sharing that joy with others through the occasional talk or blog post. He's passionate about doing useful things and amazed that he gets paid to do this.</p>

## Recorded At:

 - Austin CodeCamp
