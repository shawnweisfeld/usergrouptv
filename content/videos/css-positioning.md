## Abstract:

<p>It’s minutes before you should be leaving work on a Friday afternoon but you can’t bring yourself to quit until you fix this UI bug. The label is over the text box and you know it should be a simply fix but, for some reason, nothing is working. You try display: inline. Nope. display:inline-block. Nothing. position: absolute. That makes it worse. Position: relative. Bingo! Why did that work? Doesn’t matter, just commit and push.</p>
<p>If you’ve ever been in this position (no pun intended), then come discover how to use CSS positioning and finally understand what the float is going on.</p>
