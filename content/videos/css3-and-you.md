## Speaker:

 - Patrick Forringer

## Abstract:

<p>CSS3 has become popular topic with the growing prevalence of modern browsers and the introduction HTML5 into upcoming Windows 8 Metro Apps. This Session will go over new and useful CSS3 features you may not know about, with a focus on IE9 and IE10 support.</p>

## Bio:

 - <p>My passion for all things web started back in the 90's when my father installed Netscape Navigator. The type of information available on the web at that time wasn't very geared toward 6-10 year olds, but my interest was piqued. I'm a recent Tulsa transplant from upstate NY, and am always looking for ways to actively contribute to the community.</p>
