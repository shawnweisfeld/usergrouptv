  "abstract": "<p>Most of us spend our days coding in object oriented (OO) languages like C#, Java or C++. By looking at other programming paradigms we have an opportunity to reason about problems in different ways, and gain a deeper understanding of what's in our OO toolkit. This talk takes an idiomatic approach to functional programming (FP) using F#. At the end of the talk you'll have a better idea of what FP is, know what \"currying\" is, and have the information you need to get started with F#.</p>",
