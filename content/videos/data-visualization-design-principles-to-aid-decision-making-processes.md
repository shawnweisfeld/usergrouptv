## Abstract:

<p>Visualizing Data is an important skill. But does a particular visualization, dashboard, or application assist in better decision making? Whenever a data analysis is being performed, it must be designed around the business questions and the potential decisions that could be made. The Decision Makers know the business and have current analysis tools to make decisions, but those tools may be slow, expensive, inflexible, siloed, and providing answers to yesterday's questions. The promise of today's Visualization tools is to improve their decision processes by presenting key data in an interactive format, in a context understandable to the decision maker, and allows the decision maker to rapidly test possible decisions with predictions. This session will discuss three key aspects of good visualization design in decision making: context of the business, interactivity, and ease of testing alternatives. </p>
