## Abstract:

<p>Designing databases from User requirements is an art form even when you focus on implementing a strict ANSI compliant system. There is more to the database design then table structures and T-SQL statements. In this session you will learn how to translate user requirements into a database design which utilizes the new and existing features to create an efficient and manageable system. </p>
