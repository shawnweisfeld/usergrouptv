JSON can sometimes be intimidating for those more familiar with tabular or XML data exchange formats. We’ll demystify JSON with a high-level overview of the format. We’ll then discuss the variety of built-in T-SQL functionality available to store, query, or even generate JSON within your SQL Server databases.\r\n</p>",
