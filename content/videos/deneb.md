  "abstract": "Deneb is a custom visual that provides access to the Vega and Vega-Lite languages inside Power BI. These languages are \"visualization grammars\" developed by the University of Washington Interactive Data Lab and use a declarative, JSON-based format. This gives you a lot of power to build a range of bespoke visual designs with significantly less effort than learning web development techniques and coding them from scratch. In this session Daniel will introduce the basic concepts of these languages, and show you how you can use Deneb to start building and iterating your own designs. Kerry will then present some further examples and applications of Deneb to help realize your data stories.",
