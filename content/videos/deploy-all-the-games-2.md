## Abstract:

<p>Come see how you can use Unity3D toolset to build and deploy your game to ALL THE DEVICES!. New devices do not need ports from scratch anymore, its the 21st Century.</p>
<p>We will explore how to deal with differing form factors, pixel densities, graphics support, input systems and other multi platform madness.</p>
<p>It can be done. It’s not too hard.</p>

<p>Adam is involved in many user groups in DFW and puts on the local Global Game Jam at Collin College, a crazy, worldwide race to make a game in 72.</p>
<p>On the weekends you can find him gaming, making weird food and oh yeah… programming.</p>
