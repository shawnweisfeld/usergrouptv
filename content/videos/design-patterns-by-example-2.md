In this session, we&rsquo;ll construct 5 of the most common design patterns, step-by-step, highlighting common usages and digging through the nuances that make these patterns powerful: Factory Method, Strategy, Observer, Template Method, and Decorator. You&rsquo;ll walk-away with a clear understanding of how these patterns work and how you can leverage them in your application code.</p>",
