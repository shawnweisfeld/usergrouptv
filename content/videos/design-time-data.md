## Abstract:

<p>
Lorem ipsum dolor sint.
</p><p>
You're building the next great app. You've gotten down to the last few tweaks. It's really close!
</p><p>
But every time you make a change, you have to run the app to see how it works. That text block looked good in the designer, but it's too short for the content. The spacing between list box items is way too close. Aaaaarg!
</p><p>
If you use design time data, you can see what the app will look like as you go. You can get the trivial stuff out of the way, and make more changes betweeen runs.
</p><p>
We'll practice design time data techniques from mockup through final polishing. In particular, we will use:
</p>

<ul><li>
In-place data</li><li>
Sample data</li><li>
Design mode view models</li><li>
Design mode models</li><li>
</li></ul>
<p>
Add these techniques into any phase of the app to make design go much more quickly.

 - <p>Michael travels through space clinging to the carbon hull of a spherical ship made of molten iron. He commands an army of microorganisms which decompose the molecules that he captures to provide chemical energy for his cells. His mission is to increase entropy throughout the universe. Michael wrote The Art of Immutable Architecture, a book on applying mathematics to building distributed systems. Learn more at https://immutablearchitecture.com. In his spare time, he records Pluralsight courses on CQRS, XAML Patterns, Cryptography, and Provable Code. Formerly a Microsoft MVP for seven years. He maintains the spoon-bending Assisticant, Correspondence, and Jinaga open-source libraries. He shared videos about distributed systems at historicalmodeling.com. And he helps his clients at Improving benefit from the power of software mathematics. Software is math. Every class is a theorem. The compiler is the proof. And unit tests check our work.</p>
