 - Jennifer McCown

## Abstract:

<p>
	With a little T-SQL experience, you can create a stored procedure that completes a task. But it's harder to formulate a stored procedure solution with the big picture in mind. In this session, we will work through a real world scenario to develop a thorough solution. You will learn about:
</p>
<ul>
	<li>Asking the right questions to set yourself up for success</li>
	<li>
		Making the case for stored procedures over ad hoc code and other objects
	</li>
	<li>Pro tips for standardization and cross-version compliance</li>
	<li>Reevaluating and expanding on your solution</li>
	<li>Limiting inputs to reduce unexpected behaviors and errors</li>
	<li>Choosing between alternate solutions</li>
	<li>Evaluating for performance</li>
</ul>
<p>
	This session is for data professionals who can write T-SQL, but haven't spent a lot of time in SQL development.
