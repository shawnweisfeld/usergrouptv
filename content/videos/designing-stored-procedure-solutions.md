  "abstract": "<p>\r\n\tWith a little T-SQL experience, you can create a stored procedure that completes a task. But it's harder to formulate a stored procedure solution with the big picture in mind. In this session, we will work through a real world scenario to develop a thorough solution. You will learn about:\r\n</p>\r\n<ul>\r\n\t<li>Asking the right questions to set yourself up for success</li>\r\n\t<li>\r\n\t\tMaking the case for stored procedures over ad hoc code and other objects\r\n\t</li>\r\n\t<li>Pro tips for standardization and cross-version compliance</li>\r\n\t<li>Reevaluating and expanding on your solution</li>\r\n\t<li>Limiting inputs to reduce unexpected behaviors and errors</li>\r\n\t<li>Choosing between alternate solutions</li>\r\n\t<li>Evaluating for performance</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<p>\r\n\tThis session is for data professionals who can write T-SQL, but haven't spent a lot of time in SQL development.\r\n</p>",
