  "abstract": "<p>It's been a long road, but with the release of Windows 10 Microsoft finally has a single O/S and development platform that spans across devices. From the desktop to mobile to IoT and even Xbox One and beyond, Windows 10 will be the core O/S for every device running Microsoft software. With this new O/S comes the Universal Windows Platform (UWP). The platform enables you to use a single code base to run across devices while taking advantage of device specific features. This session will take a look at the UWP and what it takes to build UWP apps. We will also look at migrating existing Windows 8/8.1 apps and what types of differences that you can expect.</p>",
