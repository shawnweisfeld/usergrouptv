## Speaker:

 - Michael L Perry

## Abstract:

<p>You are losing orders. You are double-charging. And as a result, you are losing customers. When your customer sends in an order, make sure that it gets to your back end. Make sure that it gets processed once. Make sure that it gets shipped once. And, most importantly, make sure your customer gets billed once. 
</p><p> 
The typical web application is not built with durability in mind. It leaves open several small holes where data could be lost or duplicated. I’ll show you how to recognize those holes. I’ll show you tools and techniques to close those holes.
</p><p> 
In this talk, we will see:
</p>
<ul>
<li>Durable page design</li>
<li>Message-driven architecture</li>
<li>Service bus</li>
<li>Distributed transactions</li>
</ul>
<p> 
Follow these guidelines, and you will keep your customers. Even if they click Submit twice.
</p>

## Bio:

 - <p>Michael travels through space clinging to the carbon hull of a spherical ship made of molten iron. He commands an army of microorganisms which decompose the molecules that he captures to provide chemical energy for his cells. His mission is to increase entropy throughout the universe. Michael wrote The Art of Immutable Architecture, a book on applying mathematics to building distributed systems. Learn more at https://immutablearchitecture.com. In his spare time, he records Pluralsight courses on CQRS, XAML Patterns, Cryptography, and Provable Code. Formerly a Microsoft MVP for seven years. He maintains the spoon-bending Assisticant, Correspondence, and Jinaga open-source libraries. He shared videos about distributed systems at historicalmodeling.com. And he helps his clients at Improving benefit from the power of software mathematics. Software is math. Every class is a theorem. The compiler is the proof. And unit tests check our work.</p>
