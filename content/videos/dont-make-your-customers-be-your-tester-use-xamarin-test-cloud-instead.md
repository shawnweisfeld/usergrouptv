## Speaker:

 - Ryan Overton

## Abstract:

<p>With the overwhelming number of mobile devices on the market and the high frequency of OS updates, it's hard, if not nearly impossible, for mobile developers to ensure their apps will run across the myriad of devices and platforms. Let Xamarin Test Cloud take care of this so you can focus on what's important... your customers!</p>

## Bio:

 - <p>As an ICAgile Certified Professional and Certified ScrumMaster with nearly 10 years of software development experience with Microsoft technologies, I have learned a breadth of development technologies for desktop (WinForms, WPF, UWA, and UWP), web (WebForms, MVC, AngularJs, and Angular 2), and mobile (Windows CE, Windows Mobile, Windows Phone 7/8/8.1, and Xamarin). Since I first made the turtle dance around the screen using Logo, I have had a passion for development and am fortunate I get to do what I love for a living.</p>
