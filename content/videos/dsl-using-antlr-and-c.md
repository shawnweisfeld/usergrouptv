We will use Antlr to create a Lexer, Parser, and Abstract Syntax Tree for a small language we create from scratch. We will use CodeDom to generate C# code that runs it. The new language will solves a real business case. You should walk away with knowledge about how to create a language and how to actually run it.</p>",
