## Abstract:

<p>I have tried several different ways to build single-page web applications over the last 3 years.  I started with iUI.  The concept was cool but I quickly ran into road blocks.  I tried jQTouch and got a little farther but again ran into road blocks.  jQueryMobile had just come out and I though finally jQuery will get it right, but I spent all of my time fighting the framework.  Then Knockout was released and it made things a lot better, but there were still issues like url routing.  I started using a library called SammyJS and that solved the routing issue.  My app was better, but I still wasn’t happy with my view models.  They were way too big. It seemed like everything was happening in the view model.  When I was finally able to get my app working I started having trouble managing all of the JavaScript dependencies and getting them loaded in the right order!  It was all just a big pain! Then along came Durandal.</p>
<p>Durandal has solved all these problems and many more that I didn’t even realize were going to be issues like JavaScript packaging and minification, and application messaging just to name a couple.  Durandal accomplishes all of this and it is fun to use. In this talk we will dive into Durandal and the libraries that it sits on top of:  jQuery, RequireJS, and Knockout.  At the end of this session you will walk away with the tools you need to build an enterprise quality single-page web application.</p>
