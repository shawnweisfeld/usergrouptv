  "abstract": "<p>The need for organizations to provide Row Level Security (RLS) in their applications is increasing every day, often in existing applications where code changes are not easy. Microsoft has addressed this need in SQL Server 2016/2017 and Azure SQL DB with predicate based RLS and in Power BI, as well. This session will show how organizational & asset hierarchies are leveraged together to provide predicate-based RLS on tables in SQL Server 2016/2017, Azure SQL Database and Power BI without application changes. This session will go beyond the basic RLS setups and show a real-world production setup of RLS using a small number of security records to secure large and small organizations. Attendees will leave with a complete working demo they can take to their work and begin to use immediately. The demo will walk completely through creating the database, creating the application tables and security related tables, loading demo and security data, setting up the RLS and testing the RLS.</p>",
