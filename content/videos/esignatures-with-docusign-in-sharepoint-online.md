      "bio": "<p>Travis Lingenfelder started his career working for a small engineering firm as both a server administrator and a developer. When SharePoint came along it seemed like a natural fit utilizing both of these passions. Travis has spent the majority of the past 12 years focused on consulting and creating solutions with SharePoint for business of all sizes. Today, his primary focus is helping companies migrate to and adopt Office 365 and its various services, including SharePoint Online. In the time he has worked with SharePoint, there have been many changes, and he sees the shift that is currently happening with SharePoint Online to be the most exciting yet.</p>",
