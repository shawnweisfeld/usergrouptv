While not a new concept, event-driven architecture is seeing a new life as applications move to cloud as it provides much more robust possibilities to solve business problems of today and in the future. In this session, you will learn how to create a loosely coupled architecture for your business that has the domain at the core. You will learn the basics of event-driven architecture, how to transform your complex systems to become event driven, and what benefits this architecture brings to your businesses. The overall architecture is applicable to any cloud stack, but this session will have examples using Azure offerings.",
