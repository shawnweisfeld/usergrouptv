I plan to share some invaluable lessons I learned the hard way, and provide some resources that have truly helped/continue to help me, all while highlighting parallel female superheroes' powers and abilities. I'll talk about negotiation, asking for a promotion, ongoing learning/skill set acquisition &amp; managing up.</p>",
