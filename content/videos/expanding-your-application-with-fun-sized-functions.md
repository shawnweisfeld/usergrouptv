## Abstract:

<p>Azure Functions are the ultimate evolution of abstracting away the underlying hardware. No longer do you need to worry about memory or cores - instead you can let the beauty of your code wash over you. In this talk we're going to build a real world application using Azure functions from the beginning to the end.</p>
