## Abstract:

<p>Writing software that can be maintained is and always has been crucial. But so is writing software that can be enhanced and extended. It’s become quite commonplace for many apps today to expose APIs so externally written apps can have access to their data or their services. But imagine how cool it is to expose an API for changing or extending an application’s functionality. I’m talking about the ability to use the architecture of an application in order to enhance that system. This is the power of the patterns and techniques I’m going to show you in this session. They’re very useful and very geeky so bring your propeller hat.

## Bio:

 - <p>Whether playing on the local Radio Shack’s TRS-80 or designing systems for clients around the globe, Miguel has been writing software since he was 12 years old. He insists on staying heavily involved and up-to-date on all aspects of software application design & development, and projects that diversity onto the type of training and consulting he provides to his customers and believes that it’s never just about understanding the technologies, but how technologies work together. In fact, it is on this concept that Miguel based two of his Pluralsight courses, Building End-to-End Multi-Client Service Oriented Applications, which was #1 for several weeks, and Developing Extensible Sotware. Miguel is a Microsoft MVP since 2005 and when he’s not consulting or training, Miguel speaks at conferences around the world, practices combining on-stage tech and comedy, and never misses a Formula 1 race. But best of all, he’s the proud father of a very tech-savvy 10 year old girl, and a proud husband to the woman that homeschools her.
