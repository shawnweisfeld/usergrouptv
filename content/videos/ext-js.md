You have never heard of this framework before, much less do you consider yourself a JavaScript programmer, so is it time to update your resume or make it happen in spite of the odds yet again? If you are curious about why some people love Ext Js, and also why some love to hate it, you will want to join Tim as he shares his experiences learning Ext Js and reintroducing himself with JavaScript in general.</p>",
