## Abstract:

<p>Everyone knows TDD (Test Driven Development), but have you heard of FDD (FAITH Driven Development)? I first learned about this spritually rewarding practice in 2009 from an April Fools Joke published in SDTimes magazine.</p>
<p>After years of experience and seeing the adoption (or lack there of) of TDD, I came to realize that I truly do BELEIVE in FAITH Driven Development</p>
<p>I BELIEVE you will too!</p>
<p>This session will entertain you and more importantly provide you with the motivation and ammunition to take your code to a heavenly state!?Come get some FAITH!</p>
