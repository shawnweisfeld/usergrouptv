## Abstract:

In this session, we will talk about how easy it is to deploy applications to Microsoft's cloud platform - Windows Azure, starting from scratch i.e. zero code. We will build an app in Visual Studio and set up continuous deployment &amp; start deploying shippable code in quick iterations. No slides. Just code.
