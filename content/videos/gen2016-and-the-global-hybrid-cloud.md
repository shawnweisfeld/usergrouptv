## Abstract:

<p>THEME:  Like it or not, our industry is driving the world to Gen2016™ {Windows 2016, SQL Server 2016, Azure, etc.,} technologies.   This GENeration shift is filled with buzzwords, that hover around or land-on “HYBRID Cloud”.   Hint: HCCUG.org has been speaking, for many years, about “Hybrid Cloud” and its “Global” perspective/implications/offering, (e.g., the free-ish offerings in US/China/EU). </p>
<p>«±» SESSION:  The focus is on Data (e.g., Big Data & Small Data) in the Gen2016™ “Global Hybrid Cloud” offerings from both Microsoft and non-Microsoft – as it appears at this point-in-time/May2016.   This is a Level-100 session (no pre-requisites), and is for those who want a jump-start on Gen2016™ offerings, irrespective of whether you are just getting started in the industry, and/or retooling/realigning/revamping your skill set.</p>
