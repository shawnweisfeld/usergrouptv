  "abstract": "<p>ORMs were supposed to make our life easier. Solve the problem of mapping the relational model to the object oriented model - but something went wrong. Lazy loading, leaky abstractions, factories, mapping nightmares - I thought this was supposed to be easy? Enter the Micro-ORM. In this session we'll look at the latest and greatest in Micro-Orms with NPoco. Instead of trying to abstract the database, we'll embrace it, getting right to the point and sidestepping the issues that traditional ORMs introduce.</p>",
