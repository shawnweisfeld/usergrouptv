## Speaker:

 - Harold Pulcher

## Abstract:

<p>This is an introduction to Windows 10 IoT core. I will show how to set up the OS on a raspberry pi. Include live demonstrations of code running on hardware utilizing both input and output devices. We will go over how debugging on raspberry pi works, and how easy it is to get started in this field.According to some estimates, there will be 50 Billion connected devices by 2020. The release of Windows 10 core IoT has enabled the creation of the next generation of intelligent devices. In this talk you?ll learn about how the Windows 10 family will help build the next generation devices based on hardware like the Raspberry Pi, as well as how to extend these devices with new capabilities. We will walk through setting up the development environment including the desktop, the raspberry pi. We will demonstrate how to extend the platform to include support for popular Internet of Things (IoT) hardware interfaces. This is the beginning step for you to build rich devices from fun DIY home projects through enterprise level control systems.</p>
