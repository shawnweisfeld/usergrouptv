In this session, Billy Hollis brings out his crystal ball and explains the six parts of cloud technology that will fuel extraordinary innovation in business apps, including three that donâ€™t exist yet! Come get an entertaining take on how to think about current app development will evolve with the changes cloud technologies will bring.</p>
