  "abstract": "<p>Cloud platforms such as Azure and AWS are still in their early adoption phase. Businesses are finding ways to use cloud technology, but the emphasis is on the built-in scalability and distributed nature of the cloud. This will evolve in the next few years as developers find new ways to use the cloud and as providers create new services. In this session, Billy Hollis brings out his crystal ball and explains the six parts of cloud technology that will fuel extraordinary innovation in business apps, including three that don’t exist yet! Come get an entertaining take on how to think about current app development will evolve with the changes cloud technologies will bring.</p>",
