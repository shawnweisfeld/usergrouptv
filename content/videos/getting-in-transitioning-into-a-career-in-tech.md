## Abstract:

<p>If you are brand new to the tech industry and are wondering how to get started, or transitioning into tech from a different career, this talk is for you!
I recently reinvented my career from the ground up and went from marketing to software engineering in the course of a year. In a short period of time, I tried everything from self-teaching, to remote self-paced classes, and ultimately a coding bootcamp. This talk will cover: 1) How to determine if tech is right for you, 2) How to develop a growth mindset to help you be successful in tech, 3) Understanding how you learn best, 4) Getting your first tech job</p>
