If you don't take proper care of a car's engine, you get fewer miles per gallon and lose speed and power— eventually, your neglect mandates costly repairs. Similarly, all businesses and organizations have vehicles, or databases, filled with valuable information. As data grows performance problems arise. If a medical practice has a slow or inaccessible path to medical records, doctors and staff cannot provide high-quality or safe care for their patients. When a sales team's CRM database is sluggish and unreliable, they will not make money or grow a business. A professional sports club need 24/7 fast access to compelling statistics to render the best possible game-day decisions. You will walk away from this webinar with tips to optimize your organizations database. Just like Procure SQL has done for the three cases above. ",
