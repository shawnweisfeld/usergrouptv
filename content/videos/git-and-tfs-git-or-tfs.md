  "abstract": "<p>Do you know git? Have you used TFS? When you start a new job & they're using TFS, do you wish they were using git INSTEAD? Why don't YOU use them TOGETHER? The git-tfs bridge enables the best of both worlds: TFS for devs who (like I used to say) \"have no interest in learning a command-line tool,\" while enabling those of use who have seen git solve version control challenges previously assumed unsolvable, to use our new git love. This is a level 200 talk (meaning if you've never used git, this talk is not for you... yet. Go to a \"what is git?\" talk first. We will not cover the time-consuming \"what is a dvcs?\" topics and such). If you've used both TFS & git, but only seperately, or want to know even MORE about using both together, this talk is for you.</p>",
