Started researching Artificial Intelligence and Neural Networks, but it all just makes your head hurt? Wish there was an easy to consume web service by the leading researchers in the field that you could just call to teach your app/Web Site to see, hear, speak, understand and interpret your user needs through natural methods of communication?
