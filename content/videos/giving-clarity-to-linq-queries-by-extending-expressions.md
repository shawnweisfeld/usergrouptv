## Abstract:

<p>In this session we'll learn about .Net Expression trees by discovering how they work and applying the knowledge to LINQ using the pipes and filters pattern. LINQ and Entity Framework are both commonly used in the .Net ecosystem, but even well-written applications can have LINQ queries that are difficult to understand. Because LINQ is so flexible, it can be written in ways that fail to communicate the developer’s intent. Well-written LINQ should be so clear as to be self-documenting. To write clear LINQ, it helps to understand the details of a few LINQ components that improve LINQ’s readability.</p>
