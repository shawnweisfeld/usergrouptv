Discuss why we model data, the different modeling type, and different modeling techniques. Explore why and when to use different modeling techniques. Explain dimensional modeling when developing data warehouses, SSAS Cubes, and Power BI Analytics. Sample model diagrams will be used to explain these different modeling techniques and try to bring a more tangible aspect to the theoretical aspects of the discussion. Why Model Data: The Value of Enterprise Data & Business Benefits of Data Modeling. Different Model Types: Conceptual / Logical / Physical &  Dimensional. Different Modeling Techniques: Star & Snow Flake Schema, Slowly Changing Dimensions & Many to Many Relationships</p>",
