Although it’s tempting to compare it with existing technologies like OData, the purpose and implementation are both quite different. In this session, Jeremy explains the benefits and use cases for GraphQL, shares some solutions that work well in .NET and of course will show plenty of code and demos to illustrate how the pieces fit together. If you write software that involves a web or desktop front end that communicates with a backend, this is a session you don’t want to miss.\r\n",
