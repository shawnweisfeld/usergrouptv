Even with experienced project leadership it can be very difficult to know that all preliminary preparations are complete. Worse yet, with such a large and complicated project, it can be very difficult to know when the project has actually been successfully completed. Don't you want some help sorting through this enormous pile of work? You need to zero in on the critical items that need to be prepared, executed, and completed to ensure a successful cloud migration project. Join an experienced cloud migration consultant for a targeted walkthrough of their cloud migration success checklist so you can make sure your project gets off to a good start and reaches a successful completion.",
