  "abstract": "<p>Learn how following your passion and deepening your technical area of focus can help you create a wide-sweeping impact and how you can be awarded as an MVP! The MVP community is comprised of over 4,000 MVPs worldwide, and offers you a rich and diverse network of talented tech experts who can help you learn new skills and advance your career. As an MVP, you also gain insider access to Microsoft product development teams, and a plethora of other benefits. Come join the discussion and learn how to reap the rewards of your best season yet! I delivered this talk at CodeMash in Sandusky, Ohio, and had a panel of 7 MVPs speak for part of the session to educate attendees on how they can be awarded in the future. Many of the attendees noted on Twitter that this was their favorite session of CodeMash. Attendees have appreciated the transparency and awareness I bring to the MVP nomination process through this talk. It is also a great way for attendees to meet Microsoft MVPs and make connections with other community leaders since much of the talk is driven by questions from the audience. This talk is ideally suited to community leaders and those active in the community (speakers, bloggers, etc), but is also suitable for attendees who are new to the community and looking to build connections to widen their impact. </p>",
