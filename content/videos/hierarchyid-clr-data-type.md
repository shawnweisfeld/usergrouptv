  "abstract": "<p>Microsoft SQL Server 2008 HierarchyID CLR Data Type Presentation. Michael Kappel talks about HierarchyIDs including what they are, how to use them, when to use them, and also when not to. Microsoft has made implementing parent-child relationships faster and simpler to implement successfully through the new native support of hierarchical data in SQL Server 2008. The HierarchyID is a common language runtime (CLR) data type and because of this Microsoft was able to build in a number of methods to make traversing nodes simple. Initial setup and configuration of the HierarchyID data type can seem tricky and confusing at first. Especially with real work situations like having multiple root nodes or both branch and root nodes simultaneously. In this demonstration I will setup and implement standard node branching as well as Multi-root and tree branch/root combinations for advanced hierarchical data scenarios. HierarchyID is a powerful solution to Parent, Child, Ancestor, Descendent, and Sibling data management. The true genius of the HierarchyID data type is simple and flexible design that is shockingly fast in node related quires.</p>",
