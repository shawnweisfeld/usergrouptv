## Speaker:

 - Ryan Adams

## Abstract:

<p>If you have ever had a Kerberos or SSPI context error, then you won't want to miss this session. SQL Server has a large surface area and Active Directory can influence a big part of it. I will discuss AD DNS configuration, Group Policy Objects, Kerberos (of course), and how all of them affect your SQL Server. By the end of the session you'll have a check list of things to discuss with your domain administrator when you return to work.
