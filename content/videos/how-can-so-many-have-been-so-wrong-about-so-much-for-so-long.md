## Speaker:

 - Udi Dahan

## Abstract:

<p>In this half-technical, half-philosophical talk, Udi will debunk many of the best practices in software, explain why Agile methodologies are failing in so many organizations, and describe some pretty important problems that many developers are totally oblivious of. You might not want to bring any non-technical managers with you to this talk – you’ll probably want some time to deal with these issues quietly before exposing these topics to upper management.
</p>

## Bio:

 - <p>Udi Dahan is The Software Simplist, an internationally renowned expert on software architecture and design. As one of the world’s thought leaders in the areas of Service-Oriented Architecture, Domain-Driven Design, co-creator of the Command/Query Responsibility Segregation pattern, and founder of NServiceBus (the most popular service bus on the .NET platform), companies from all over the world turn to Udi for help on their mission critical projects.
