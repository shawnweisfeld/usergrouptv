  "abstract": "<p>The idea behind every framework is to implement recognizable and consistent workflows and processes, identify a common \r\n\r\nvocabulary and theme, and establish a set of understood rules and boundaries. Scrum, as an Agile development process framework, \r\n\r\nprovides great transparency in the development process and can help teams communicate more effectively and gain trust in each \r\n\r\nother. However, things can get frustrating when team members violate the very basic principles and try to make their own \r\n\r\n'flavor'.</p>\r\n<p>\r\nWe've all seen it. And if you haven't seen it, image playing a game that your friends call football but instead of using the \r\n\r\npigskin, you must ride around on bicycles and try to throw a giant hula-hoop around the uprights. Sure, that game might be fun, \r\n\r\nbut it isnâ€™t football and trying to call it football will only tick off those who really understand what football is.\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\nThis talk is going to explore 7 ways of misusing Scrum, violating principles, changing rules and being just plain wrong that will \r\n\r\ntick off other Scrum developers and leave them looking for greener pastures.</p>",
