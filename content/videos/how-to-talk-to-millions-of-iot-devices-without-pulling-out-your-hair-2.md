  "abstract": "<p>How do you keep track these various devices? How do they communicate information back to and forth? I show how to configure the devices, communicate in both directions, and how to test those communication channels. I will be using both simulated devices as well as real hardware for the demos.You?ve have heard and read about this thing called the Internet of Things (IoT). With all media hype about IoT and the new paradigm it brings, it?s easy to feel overwhelmed. When you hear about companies connecting billions of devices (you have heard that right), it can be difficult to grasp how that is possible. But there?s no reason IoT has to be futuristic, complicated, or overwhelming. Let?s explore this Azure IoT Suite and see just how hard it isn?t to start down that road.</p>",

He has over 25 years of experience working in Information Technology. During that time he has done everything from running network cable, setting up various companies infrastructure from the absolute bare metal, and building line of business software for many of those companies. As passionate as he is about technology, you might happen to see him checking his air reserve while at a depth of 60 feet, cooking up a mean “free-range” fruit cake, doing pre-show table magic at the improv, or making a nice piece of wood into a lot of\r\nsawdust so my wife will have potting bench for her plants.</p>",
