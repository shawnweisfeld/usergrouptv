  "abstract": "<p>There are a lot of opportunities in the emerging IoT world. I will walk you through my inspiration and implementation of my winning Hackster.io project from the 2016 Young Makers competition in China.Want to win a ?Free trip to China?? Who doesn?t, but how? Come to my talk and will walk you through my contest entry that earned me a spot on the 2016 U.S. Semi-finalist team. Did I win? Did I loose? Did I even go to China? I will answer those questions, show the project, and break down all the steps it takes to bring the project to completion. Who knows you may have an even better project rattling around in your head just waiting to get out.</p>",

      "bio": "<p>Harold Pulcher is a Microsoft MVP, co-ambassador for Hackster.io, developer, network engineer, magician, woodworker, and part time grease monkey. He has over 25 years of experience working in Information Technology. During that time he has done everything from running network cable, setting up various companies infrastructure from the absolute bare metal, and building line of business software for many of those companies. As passionate as he is about technology, you might happen to see him checking his air reserve while at a depth of 60 feet, cooking up a mean “free-range” fruit cake, doing pre-show table magic at the improv, or making a nice piece of wood into a lot of\r\nsawdust so my wife will have potting bench for her plants.</p>",
