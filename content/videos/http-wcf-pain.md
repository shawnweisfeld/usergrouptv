The tons of XML, the fact that you're abstracted from HTTP, and other less than fun things. Fortunately, there is a team at Microsoft who is leading the way to make working with WCF in an HTTP centric fashion much better. Come learn how to call a WCF service from jQuery with just 1 line of code, how very easy code configuration can be so you don't have to do XML, and how to use an IoC container with only a little bit of pain.</p>",
