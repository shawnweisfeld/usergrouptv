## Abstract:

<p>Face it – it’s going to happen. It’s going to happen to you, it’s going to happen to your company and it’s definitely happened to me! Security incidents are now just a part of normal everyday online life and we need to adapt to the new reality. In this talk, we’ll look at how security is changing and the things we can do to evolve our approaches in the era of the data breach. You’ll see many of the common attacks organisations are falling victim to today, how our attitudes towards passwords are changing, how to get responsible disclosure right (both as an individual and an organisation) and get a look inside some of the more modern security defences out browsers offer us today. This talk is a mix of real world events, practical coding and face-palmingly painful security examples.</p>
