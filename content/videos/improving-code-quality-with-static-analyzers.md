  "abstract": "How do you keep code consistent across a team or make sure your independent code follows accepted standards, use a Static Analyzer tool. See how to use some of these tools for your .Net, JavaScript, Style sheets, etc. to improve your code as an independent or large team lead.\r\n\r\nWhether you're an independent developer that needs assistance reviewing your code, or a member of a large team that wants to keep code consistency among the team, static analyzer tools can help identify and optionally fix issues in your code. Many platforms have their own version to help based on the language, including Roslyn, JsLint, CssLint, SonarQube. FxCop, StyleCop, etc. We'll take a look at some of these tools and explore how they can help identify issues in your code and improve maintainability and decrease errors before you deploy to production. We'll also look at the ability to build your own tool to enforce rules in your specific domain.",
