The session takes a practical look at in-memory OLTP, including its strengths and weaknesses, and gives practical guidance for using in-memory tables in SQL Server 2014. The session will use the latest CTP, so there are limitations in some of the features. Futures will be discussed where confirmed by Microsoft.</p>",
