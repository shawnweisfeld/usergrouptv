## Speaker:

 - Gregory Beamer

## Abstract:

<p> One of the most exciting new features in SQL Server 2014 is the ability to move your tables into memory. This sessions focuses on this in-memory OLTP capability. The session takes a practical look at in-memory OLTP, including its strengths and weaknesses, and gives practical guidance for using in-memory tables in SQL Server 2014. The session will use the latest CTP, so there are limitations in some of the features. Futures will be discussed where confirmed by Microsoft.</p>
