## Abstract:

<p>What support should a business user have in order to increase the value of SharePoint tool? Having SharePoint, is not the end purpose of IT, it is like giving a tool box and not showing how to use the tools or what they are used for. Business users need special support that is not only technical maintenance when they need it, but it is on-going as part of training and what is possible to do with those tools. The value of SharePoint increases as users use it for more and more business processes, but how do business users know of what is possible with SharePoint and how do they implement it?</p>

## Bio:

 - <p>Daniel Lioznyansky is an experienced Business Consultant who integrates technical expertise with business know how and is a co-founder of Zont Services which provides business users SharePoint support on a per user/month subscription model. Over the last 20 years, he has worked with large Fortune 100 companies, big 5 consulting companies, start-ups and everything in between. From academia and government agencies to O&G, Supply Chain/Logistics, Financial and Service companies. Daniel has recently done extensive work in Knowledge Management and Gamification arenas of business consulting. What he and a number of top consultants have found was that the business follow-through on SharePoint implementations, once the project has completed, was always missing the long term support aspect which didn’t maximize the SharePoint’s value extraction. SharePoint implementations diminished in value over time instead of increasing due to lack of continual business user support, thus he co-founded Zont Services to fill in this gap.
