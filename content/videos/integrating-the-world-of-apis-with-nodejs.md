  "abstract": "<p>What is an API? Who uses them? Why should we use APIs when developing? How do I use one? In this workshop, you will be introduced to REST APIs, AJAX & jQuery, and NodeJS. Learn about why you should use APIs in your web applications and how to incorporate AJAX calls into a NodeJS based application. Using common tools that have publicly available APIs, such as Google Calendar or Slack, you’ll leave knowing how to incorporate an API call into a web app. Learn about developing proper error message handling for bad calls and responses and how to debug them. Understand what a DOM is and how to manipulate it with a positive API response. You’ll leave with a deeper understanding of what a REST API is, what AJAX and jQuery are, and how to integrate all these tools into their front-end application using NodeJS.</p>",
