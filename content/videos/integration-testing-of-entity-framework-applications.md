You?ll see what problems a good test suite can catch before they get a chance to slow you down.There are many reasons that we don?t test our data access code. It?s slow. It?s brittle. It's hard to set up. But the data access layer is core to our applications. It?s essential that we get it right.A good integration test suite is the most valuable asset that your team can invest in. It will help you code with confidence, knowing that you are not breaking existing functionality as you add new features. Instead of slowing you down, properly written integration tests can increase your team?s velocity.Using continuous integration, you can run your integration test suite quickly and repeatably against a test database. Get feedback quickly when there is a problem. Initialize test data. Isolate tests from one another. Structure tests to make them more readable, and resilient to change.</p>",

Michael wrote The Art of Immutable Architecture, a book on applying mathematics to building distributed systems. Learn more at https://immutablearchitecture.com. Michael has recorded Pluralsight courses on Distributed Systems, XAML Patterns, and Cryptography, in addition to Provable Code. Formerly a Microsoft MVP for seven years, he maintains the spoon-bending Assisticant and Jinaga open-source libraries. You can find his videos about distributed systems at historicalmodeling.com.
