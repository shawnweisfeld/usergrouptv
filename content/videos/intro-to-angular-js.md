In this talk we'll cover the basics of Angular with live code and demos, using Laravel PHP to power the back-end JSON API.</p>\r\n<p>Demo will include setting up an Angular application, pulling JSON from a server, binding data to your view, posting data from a form, and showing error and success messages. All \"real world\" stuff you can use in your applications, even if they aren't fancy single page applications!</p>\r\n<p>We'll also check out some other web related goodies like Gulp.js for compiling our CSS (LESS) and JavaScript files.</p>",
