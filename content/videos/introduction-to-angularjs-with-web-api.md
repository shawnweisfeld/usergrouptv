It can be a daunting task to try and figure out where you should focus your valuable continuous improvement time or even more stressful if you are responsible for the technology direction of your project. In this session we will take a look at why I feel that AngularJs is worth considering. In this example driven session we will explore a lot of the basic features that make this framework exciting by building out a sample shopping cart application on top of a ASP.Net Web API back end. All of the code will be hosted on GitHub in an easy to consume fashion so that you can take lessons learned and apply them on your projects.</p>",
