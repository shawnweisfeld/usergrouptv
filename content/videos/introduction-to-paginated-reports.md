It is not a replacement for Power BI but a complimenting service when you need that snap shot report. Now that Premium features are more available through Premium per User licenses, paginated reports are a good solution for more companies. In this session we will start with the basics, assuming no prior knowledge and cover the following topics. Connecting to data and creating datasets, Creating a tabular report and adding parameters, Publishing and Subscribing to a report, Creating a template, Connecting to a Power BI dataset & Visuals and Conditional Formatting\r\n",
