## Abstract:

<p>SQL Server 2016 introduces the concept of temporal tables, also called system-versioned tables. This new feature allows SQL Server to automatically keep track of the history of rows in any table for which it is enabled. In this session we'll cover the basics on how to create and work with temporal tables, including the new FOR SYSTEM_TIME query clause, and we'll discuss some of the ways that they may or may not fill a need in your environment.</p>
