## Abstract:

<p>A perfectly tuned database only becomes valuable when the data becomes usable to the end consumer. Giant cross tabs might have all the data but often donâ€™t allow users to understand what is happening. This talk will help you better understand the gap between end users and your database. Visual Analytics takes into account the reality of how the human mind processes information to enable users to quickly get the answers they need. We will cover some principles of visual perception and how these perceptions can influence worksheet and dashboard design. Tableau a leading visual analytics tool will be demoed and used to provide examples.
