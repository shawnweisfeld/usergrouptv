With libraries such as Polymer that are built on top of Web Components, it is now possible to easily create fast Progressive Web Apps (PWAs) without the overhead of a framework. In this workshop, we'll begin with a brief introduction to Web Components and Polymer, and then dive into hands-on experiences with the core aspects of Web Components: the <template> tag, Custom Elements, and the Shadow DOM. This workshop assumes an understanding of HTML, CSS & JavaScript. No prior experience with Web Components, Polymer, or any library or framework (Web Components or otherwise) is required</p>",
