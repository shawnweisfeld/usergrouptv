## Speaker:

 - Lee Brandt

## Abstract:

<p>Having spent most of the last 17 years writing web apps on a Microsoft platform, the switch to iOS was a tricky one for me. I will share all that I have learned in the last year making the transition. You will learn the basics of iOS programming from a .NETters perspective. For any .NET web developers looking to make the jump to iOS, but are not sure what to expect, this session is for you.</p>

## Bio:

 - <p>After almost two decades writing software professionally (and a few years unprofessionally before that), Lee Brandt still continues to learn every day. He has led teams in small and large companies and always manages to keep the business needs at the forefront of software development efforts. He speaks internationally about software development, from both a technical and business perspective, and loves to teach others what he learns. Lee writes software in Objective-C, JavaScript and C#... mostly. He is a Microsoft Most Valuable Professional in Visual C#, one of the directors of the Kansas City Developer Conference (KCDC). Lee is a decorated Gulf War veteran, a husband, a proud pet parent and loves to play the drums whenever he gets any spare time.
