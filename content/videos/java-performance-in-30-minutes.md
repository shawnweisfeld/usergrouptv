  "abstract": "<p>The clock is ticking! With just 30 minutes of troubleshooting, how close can you get to finding the root cause of a Java performance problem in production? What observability tools would you use? What subsystems would you investigate? This presentations shows one approach to getting the most out of your 30 minutes and aims to show that much more is possible than is generally thought, even for Java developers with little exposure to performance tuning. You will learn to identify the most widespread, repeated and pernicious Java performance defects using walk-throughs of more than a dozen server-side performance puzzles that are ready to run on your own machine. As an antidote to pervasive and lackluster average response times that are multi-second throughout the industry, this presentation provides a long absent, easy-to-follow performance training regimen that we all should master early on in our careers. This presentation is your guided tour to how much is really possible in 30 minutes.</p>",
