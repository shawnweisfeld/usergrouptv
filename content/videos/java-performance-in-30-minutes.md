## Speaker:

 - Erik Ostermueller

## Abstract:

<p>The clock is ticking! With just 30 minutes of troubleshooting, how close can you get to finding the root cause of a Java performance problem in production? What observability tools would you use? What subsystems would you investigate? This presentations shows one approach to getting the most out of your 30 minutes and aims to show that much more is possible than is generally thought, even for Java developers with little exposure to performance tuning. You will learn to identify the most widespread, repeated and pernicious Java performance defects using walk-throughs of more than a dozen server-side performance puzzles that are ready to run on your own machine. As an antidote to pervasive and lackluster average response times that are multi-second throughout the industry, this presentation provides a long absent, easy-to-follow performance training regimen that we all should master early on in our careers. This presentation is your guided tour to how much is really possible in 30 minutes.</p>

## Bio:

 - <p>Erik Ostermueller has spent the last 10 years or so years tuning high throughput Java financial systems in North and South America, Europe and Asia. In 2011, he wrote a paper for an international performance conference titled “How to Help Developers (Finally) Find Their Own Performance Defects” that won “Best Paper” and the “Mullen Award” for best speaker. The proceeds of this award financed an 8-city speaking tour in the US, Canada, UK, and Italy. Founder of heapSpank.org and wuqiSpank.org and a contributor to JMeter-Plugins and other open source projects.</p>
