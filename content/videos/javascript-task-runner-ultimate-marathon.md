  "abstract": "<p>\r\nLike shoes on an assembly line, we get a lot of javascript runners churned out. Grunt? Gulp? Broccoli? What makes these tools different, and when do I use them? In this talk, we will examine practical use cases, how to develop plugins and what the fundamental design philosophies are in various client-side task runners. You may think it ends at the business-as-usual javascript develop, but it doesn't. Even designers working in a different language or just trying to automate your routines outside the context of a build task, can grab onto these runners and make the world a better place.</p>",
