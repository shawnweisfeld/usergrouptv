And it's getting common enough that it's now hard to push back and request the data get converted to some time of table format; you are expected to hand JSON data now. So let's look at the built-in ways to handle it natively in SQL Server, starting with 2016. There are various ways import and export the data, some special considerations since the data can be nested and denormalized with implicit linking. Luckily, compared to XML data, we have a few additional built in functions that make working with JSON much easier than XML. We won't cover external programs and manual processing of the JSON strings, since SQL Server can natively handle the data.",
