## Speaker:

 - Ken Byrd

## Abstract:

<p>Frameworks which simplify JavaScript development are very popular today… but unfortunately many developers use these frameworks without a solid understanding of the JavaScript language. As JavaScript guru Douglas Crockford says: “It is a language with enormous expressive power. It is even better when you know what you're doing.” Come learn about the JavaScript language – how it works and pitfalls to avoid – and be prepared to offer your own tips and tricks!</p>
