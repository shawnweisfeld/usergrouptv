## Abstract:

<p>Visual Studio 2015 includes two new exciting features, integration of the NET Compiler Platform (A.K.A.-Project Roslyn) and live code analyzers. Live code analyzers leverage the compiler platform, allowing you to easily integrate into Visual Studio in order to identify to the C# or VB developer in real time where they are not following guidance. Along with reporting an issue, you have the ability to provide them with the option of automatically correcting their code using a recommendation. Unlike FxCop and Visual Studio Code Analysis, custom rules for live code analyzers are supported by the product group and any .NET developer can write them. In this session you will be introduced to the live code analyzer feature for C# and VB as well as receive a brief primer on the compiler platform. We will be walking through a demo of creating a custom live code analyzer and code fix provider.</p>
