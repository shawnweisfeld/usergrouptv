  "abstract": "<p>Agile as a software movement has just reached the decade mark, though some of the seminal processes such as Scrum and XP had their genesis years earlier. In honor of this milestone, we&rsquo;ll take a look at Agile and compare it to the \"Many Worlds\" theory of Quantum Mechanics to draw analogies between Agile done well and agile done poorly. Finally, we&rsquo;ll dig into a key principle underlying Agile, the principle of reducing work in progress. We&rsquo;ll discuss how that principle can be applied in your organization today to provide incremental and sustainable improvements to your software delivery.</p>",
