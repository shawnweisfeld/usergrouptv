  "abstract": "<p>Most agile practitioners first learn agile by reading a book, attending a class, or attending local meetings. But learning lean and agile concepts works best when we're able to put some concrete examples and practice behind the concept. By adding a set of games and exercises that teach and reinforce lean and agile concepts to our toolboxes, change agents can provide some practical basis for conversations both inside and outside their organization. Being able to talk beyond anecdote and theory and actually demonstrate why something works the way we think it does is a powerful statement. The games in this session will cover a variety of lean and agile concepts, including: Preferring small batch sizes and maximizing customer value, Identifying bottlenecks and the differences between local and system-wide optimizations, Encouraging experimentation and risk-taking, Demonstrating the need for good communication, Backlog prioritization and delivering on commitments. Following the workshop, attendees will have access to all of the workshop games and be able to run these exercises and games with their teams, managers, and executives.</p>",
