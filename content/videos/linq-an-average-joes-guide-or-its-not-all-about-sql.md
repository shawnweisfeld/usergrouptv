  "abstract": "<p>Microsoft Language Integrated Query (LINQ) offers developers a new way to query data using strongly-typed queries and strongly-typed results, common across a number of disparate data types including relational databases, .NET objects, and XML. By using strongly-typed queries and results, LINQ improves developer productivity with the benefits of IntelliSense and compile-time error checking. In this discussion, Cory will demonstrate the basics of LINQ and how it provides much more than just the ability to query a SQL Server database.</p>",
