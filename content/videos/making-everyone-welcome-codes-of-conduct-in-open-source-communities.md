  "abstract": "<p>Communities thrive when people feel welcome, invited, and safe. Having a code of conduct is an important tool in creating that environment. In the last few years, more and more technology events and communities have developed and deployed codes of conduct for their participants. In fact, many regular conference speakers are now refusing to present at any conference that doesn’t adopt a code of conduct of some sort. In this session, we’ll learn about the importance of these critical documents, and how members of communities such as women, people of color, LGBT people, and the disabled can be made more welcome by codes of conduct. We’ll also take a look at some of the common features of these documents, and share tips for designing, deploying, and enforcing them in your open source communities.</p>",
