In many ways, HTML5 lives-up to this promise, but as with any evolving standard, support across different browsers and devices is inconsistent. To effectively adopt HTML5 today, developers must master the skills that fill-in the gaps and minimize the differences between HTML5 runtimes. In this session, you will learn the essential techniques needed to create HTML5 sites and apps that truly work everywhere.</p>",
