## Abstract:

<p>Managing the SQL Server Integration Services (SSIS) ecosystem became significantly easier with the addition of the SSIS catalog in SQL Server 2012. The SSIS catalog offered many new features that made often-laborious tasks such as logging, parameterization, and variable collections much easier to develop and manage. For the SSIS developer as well as the operations staff in charge of day-to-day package execution, using the SSIS catalog helps to make their jobs easier by eliminating several tedious and error-prone processes. In this session, we will survey and demonstrate many of the useful features of the SSIS catalog. We will discuss the structure of the catalog and review how it changes the way we interact with deployed packages in SSIS. We will also demonstrate how parameters and SSIS environments help to ease the burden of supplying runtime configuration values to packages. In addition, we will demonstrate how package logging is a far simpler exercise in the new SSIS catalog.</p>
