## Speaker:

 - Sara Ford

## Abstract:

<p>When you get stuck, do you delete your .git folder and start over? Do you panic when you get into a detached head state? Do you commit only on master or consider branching an advanced topic? Have you thrown a coffee mug across the room when `git log` doesn't show your full history? (If not, you're doing better than I did when I was learning git!) Develop your git skills by applying the appropriate git commands to solve specific scenarios. Compare and contrast similar git commands using a Git Visualization tool created by the GitHub Electron team. Walk away with the ability to apply the following porcelain commands: branching, rebase vs merge, revert vs reset, reflog, interactive rebase, bisect, and more! (maybe we'll cover git rerere.) No prior knowledge of git is needed for this workshop; however, you need to be comfortable using the command line / terminal and have git installed.</p>

## Bio:

 - <p>Sara Ford decided to take a year off to try academia, because hey, it's just a 1-year contract, "What's the worst that can happen?" Sara is teaching software engineering at Cal Poly in San Luis Obispo. She is a former employee of Microsoft and GitHub and is a Distinguished Engineering Fellow at Mississippi State University. It's quite likely that Sara is the only person in the world to help start an open source project hosting site (CodePlex) at one company and help shut it down at another company (GitHub). She received her Masters degree in UX / Human Factors at San Jose State University to focus on improving the usability in developer tools. She is the author of two books on Visual Studio and has delivered numerous talks all over the world on programming technologies. Her life-long dream is to be a 97-year old weightlifter, so she can be featured on the local news.</p>
