  "abstract": "<p>Cross-platform development, what does it really mean?  HTML5, GCC, Java, PhoneGap, Mono, .NET, etc. are just a few technology stacks available, which to choose?  Does choosing HTML5 (for example) solve the problem?  Regardless of the choice, does that choice provide a solution for the developer, the end-user, or both?  What about GCC (C++), that's cross-platform, isn't it?  Java, according to Sun/Oracle, it's running on more devices than any other platform.  Devices?  PCs, game consoles, phones, tablets, media players, TVs, DVRs, etc. Platforms?  Windows (Win32), WindowsRT (Store), Windows Phone 7.5, Windows Phone 8, Windows Embedded, Android Honeycomb/Ice Cream Sandwich/Etc., iOS (iPhone/iPad), Linux (openSUSE/Ubuntu/Slackware/Etc.), Web-browser (HTML5/CSS3).  What about Cloud Computing?  What have others said regarding the choices they've made?  Do you really want to be like Facebook in regretting the decision they made which was the \"biggest mistake as a company\"?  We'll discuss the options available, weighing the pros and cons of each.  Finally, I'll share with you my own efforts to create a product that runs across as many devices / platforms as I can possibly accomplish; providing you with real-world first-hand experience of what works and what doesn't.</p>",
