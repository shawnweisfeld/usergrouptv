In Azure, we have Azure Service Bus and Azure Functions; on the AWS side, SQS and Lambdas. Each has their advantages and disadvantages when designing and building distributed systems. Join Simon Timms from Inventive.io as he helps us navigate the options and how to design a distributed system to take advantage of each one, demonstrating the differences with NServiceBus endpoints. You will learn: The options available for running cloud-native distributed systems, Serverless vs. \"serverful\" architectures, Designing endpoints for the cloud, Adapting rapidly to changing scale",

He is the author of a number of books on JavaScript and ASP.NET and blogs far less regularly than he should on both the Western Devs site (https://www.westerndevs.com/) and on his blog (https://blog.simontimms.com/). He is also the least visible member of the ASP.NET monsters (https://aspnetmonsters.com/).",
