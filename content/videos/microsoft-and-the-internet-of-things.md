## Abstract:

<p>The Internet of Things refers to a trend in technology that involves the relaying of data and communications between embedded devices, typically data aggregated by on-board sensors into a networked environment, including cloud computing platforms. We will introduce this concept through formal definition and describe its potential for impact in a variety of areas. This will extend into a thorough discussion of examples including a soil monitoring system and biofeedback heart monitor. We will then show how to create solutions for a variety of IoT scenarios through Azure Services including IoT Hubs, Streaming Analytics, and Power Bi.</p>
