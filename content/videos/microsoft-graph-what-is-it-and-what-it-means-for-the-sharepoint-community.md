  "abstract": "<p>The Microsoft Graph is a unified application programming interface (API) for accessing all the information in Microsoft 365. But you don’t need to be a programmer to appreciate what it does. Audiences: developers, IT pros, site collection owners and power users. The Microsoft Graph provides unified access to user data, Microsoft 365 services and apps such as SharePoint, OneDrive, Outlook/Exchange, Microsoft Teams, OneNote, Planner, and Excel. And more. This presentation discusses the momentum around the Microsoft Graph. We'll keep it high level: laying out its strategic value and what SharePoint professionals need to know: what is the Microsoft Graph, why it's important, how developers can use it, and what it means for the SharePoint community.</p>",
