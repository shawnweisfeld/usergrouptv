  "abstract": "<p>It is no secret that the Web is of considerable importance to Microsoft. Areas of interest range from Cloud-based back-ends to client-side technologies. Recently, Microsoft has introduced two major new initiatives of considerable importance to all Web Developers: ASP.NET vNext for development of HTML-based applications, and Microsoft Edge, as a replacement for the previous Internet Explorer browser. Both technologies are expected to have a major impact on the day-to-day lives of Web Developers. \r\n\r\n</p>\r\n<p>ASP.NET has long been a cornerstone for server-side components for all Microsoft-based web developers. In the latest incarnation, Microsoft has completely re-written ASP.NET in an effort to re-boot the platform for the next-generation Web. This has been done to support modern web development paradigms and requirements. The new version is more suitable for Cloud-operation, while still maintaining great support for on premise deployment. ASP.NET vNext supports cross platform operation, for those who prefer a Linux server platform. The new version also focusses on enhanced support for HTML5 technologies and things such as JavaScript, frameworks, build automation, and more. This part of the presentation is designed to give developers a good idea of the benefits of this exciting new version. \r\n\r\n\r\nEventbrite - Dallas ASP.Net Meeting - September 22, 2015 </p>",
