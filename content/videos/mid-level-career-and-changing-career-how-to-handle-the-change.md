 - Eileen O'Riordan

## Abstract:

<p>I have seen in the recent year that there is a gap for women who are mid-career. I attended the Grace Hopper conference last year expecting to be enlightened to find women younger than I telling us how to springboard your career. How do you adjust and traverse from being a great individual contributor when you are ten years in the role and don't have time to spend learning a new language or code? We did this prior to having children because we loved it and now we haven't the luxury of time. What do you do? I would like to talk to women who are mid-career and help them understand that they don't have to leave the industry that there are other options!</p>
