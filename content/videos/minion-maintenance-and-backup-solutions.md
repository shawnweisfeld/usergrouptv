## Abstract:

<p>
	The new Minion solutions are taking the SQL community by storm, and no wonder: they’re free, simple to use, and deeply configurable.
</p>
<p>
	In this session I’ll show you the benefits to Minion Reindex and Minion Backup:
</p>
<ul>
	<li>
		Simple installation and configuration for all shops, large or small
	</li>
	<li>Single or multi-server installation script</li>
	<li>
		Table-based configuration eliminates the need for excessive jobs
	</li>
	<li>Highly customizable options</li>
	<li>
		Flexible include and exclude options, including the use of regular expressions
	</li>
	<li>
		“Statement only” option generates statements without running them
	</li>
	<li>Extensive logging</li>
	<li>Live insight into the current maintenance operation</li>
</ul>
<p>
	Minion Backup also provides a truly superb specialty: dynamic backup tuning.
</p>
<p>
	Minion Reindex and Minion Backup scale to the size of your enterprise, from one to thousands of instances.  With Minion’s true configurability and enterprise features, you can do things never before possible in your maintenance routines.
