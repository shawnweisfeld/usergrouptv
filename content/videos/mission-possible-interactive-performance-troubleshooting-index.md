## Speaker:

 - Jim Murphy

## Abstract:

<p>Performance troubleshooting is detective work. We'll have a lab system being assaulted by PowerShell scripts  (to simulate live users), and simulated performance problems like those that can make your on-call cell phone ring too much! Do you think you have what it takes to find these "needle in the haystack" issues and resolve them quickly?  This will be a highly interactive session where we will locate the rogue queries together, work through solutions, implement them and measure the results.  In this episode we'll focus primarily on improper indexing as a common underlying problem and all will walk away with much better troubleshooting skills and an upgraded knowledge of performance tuning!</p>
