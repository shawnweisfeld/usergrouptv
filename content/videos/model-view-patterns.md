## Abstract:

<p>The separation enforced by ‘Model View’ patterns can quickly transform your application into a maintainable, modular and rapidly developed package. New features are easily added, new screens are a snap, testing is enhanced and developers and designers can more easily work simultaneously.</p>
<p>Come compare the Model-View-Controller (MVC), Model-View-Presenter (MVP) and Model-View-View-Model (MVVM) patterns. In this session, we’ll:</p>
<ul>
<li>Explore the foundation, benefits and drawbacks of each pattern at an architectural level</li>
<li>Contrast differences between each pointing out applicable situations where each may apply</li>
<li>Walk through a variety of examples on the Microsoft platform, including Microsoft MVC, ASP.NET, Silverlight and Windows Presentation Foundation</li>
</ul>
<p>You’ll walk away with a clear understanding of each pattern, with examples that you can implement in your projects.</p>
