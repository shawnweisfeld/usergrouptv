  "abstract": "<p>Regular expressions can help you perform incredible tasks with very little effort.  Need to create 1700 logins from an email request? Developers give you a single script with 300 stored procedures filled with table variables instead of temp tables?  Need to move 500 databases to a different drive?  Any of these tasks can take a long time to code, but regular expressions cuts that work from hours to seconds.  I use regular expressions all the time and I have taken many tasks down from several days to just a few minutes.  Stop writing code manually and let regular expressions do it for you.</p>\r\n<p>Here youâ€™ll learn:</p>\r\n<ul>\r\n<li>The most useful regular expression commands.</li>\r\n<li>The appropriate times to use regular expressions.</li>\r\n<li>How to use regular expressions to write code for you.</li>\r\n<li>How to incorporate regular expressions into large tasks and combine them with other methods.</li>\r\n</ul>",
