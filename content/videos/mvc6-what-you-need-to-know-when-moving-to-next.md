  "abstract": "<p>Say goodbye to System.Web! If you could drop a box of TNT on the ASP.NET stack and start over, what would it look like? Fewer dependencies, faster builds and viewing changes without compiling? Check! A composable, injectable, self-hostable stack? Check! The MVC 6 Framework has several new features, but these aren’t only skin-deep. In this session we’ll walk through the MVC pipeline, expose the new parts and discuss what the internal changes mean to the development of applications down the road.\r\n</p>",
