## Abstract:

<p>Xamarin.Forms is a new framework that allows mobile application developers to write portable apps for Android, iOS, and Windows Phone with nearly 100% reusable code while still maintaining a native look and feel for each platform. This talk will cover the basics of using Xamarin.Forms from building a basic application using XAML and MVVM to using custom renderers to customize the application for each platform.
