## Abstract:

Thinking about creating a Windows 8 app? Currently building one? Don’t forget to support Search and Share Contracts. Search and Share is supported natively in Windows 8. Search Contracts expose YOUR app to the entire Windows 8 system. Share Contracts are an easy way to make your apps social. We will walk through and implement both of these new features in Windows 8.
