  "abstract": "<p>Today, most Agile teams are trying to achieve predictable, fast delivery. While that's good, it's no longer good enough - not if we want to keep up in this highly competitive, rapidly changing world. It's not just about teams anymore. Next Level Agility is about the ability of entire organizations to quickly adapt to market changes. In this session, David Hawks will share principles and practices that are the future of Agile organizations. Together, he and the audience will reset the bar on how great Agile organizations operate by moving beyond practices like user stories, project plans, stakeholder feedback, continuous integration, and velocity, and towards a new Next Level Agile Manifesto with an emphasis on Discovery over Execution. Learn to identify organizational impediments keeping you from breaking through to the next level. Attendees will walk away from this session with concrete practices needed in order to support this new way of working.\r\n</p>",
