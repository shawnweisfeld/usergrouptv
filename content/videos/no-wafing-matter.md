## Abstract:

<p>There are vulnerabilities everywhere. Additionally, there are malicious people who can and will take advantage of these vulnerabilities. As developers, it is our responsibility to protect ourselves from these attackers. Because it is near impossible to write secure code 100% of the time we must rely on features that will help recognize when our code is being attacked, and help prevent it in the future. One way we can do this is by implementing a Web Application Firewall (WAF). A WAF will protect web and cloud applications by providing a set of rules that will cover some of the most common attacks such as cross-site scripting (XSS) and SQL injection. Both XSS and SQL Injection rank first and third in the Open Web Application Security Project's (OWASP) list of top ten most critical web application security risks. </p>
