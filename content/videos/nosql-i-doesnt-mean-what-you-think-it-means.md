## Abstract:

<p>Micro Services, horizontal scalability, and non-relational approaches are all encouraging adoption of NoSQL databases. A basic search will help reveal that NoSQL stands for “Not Only SQL,” but it’s also used as a generic term to encapsulate a wide range of specialized systems. NoSQL can include databases that approach data in a variety of ways. 1.	Key Value Store – simplest; think caching (Memcache)2.	Ordered Key Value – a step up for the key value store but allows less scanning of the database (DynamoDB)3.	Big Table – Think of these as maps-of-maps-of-maps. (Cassandra, HBase)4.	Document – Store data in some sort of document (typically JSON); This is probably what most people think about when they hear the term NoSQL. (MongoDB, ElasticSearch)5. Graphing – Tracks the relationships between objects very efficiently, but has to look at all the objects to do so. (Neo4j)</p>
