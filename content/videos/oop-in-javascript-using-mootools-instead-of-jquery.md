  "abstract": "<p>Last year I gave an in-depth presentation on building jQuery Plugins. This year I want to introduce you to MooTools, which is the framework of choice for object-oriented programming in javascript. jQuery is great for basic DOM manipulation, but with MooTools you can do all of the same things only easier and better. Build powerful UI's using javscript that greatly simplify your .NET or Java (or whatever) backend. Unit-testing, scalablity, HTML 5 web sockets and client storage are other javascript topics that I plan to cover in this session.</p>",
