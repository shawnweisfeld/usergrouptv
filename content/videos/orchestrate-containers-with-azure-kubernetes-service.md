## Abstract:

<p>Containers are awesome. They help isolate and compartmentalize your application. But they are just the building block. In this talk, weâ€™ll discuss the bigger picture and how you can get there with Azure Kubernetes Service (AKS). In this session, we will show how to simplify the deployment, management, and operations of Kubernetes using Azure Container Service (AKS). We will discuss top scenarios supported by AKS along with other Azure services such as CosmosDB, ACI, AAD; and how you can leverage DevSpace, DevOps Project and many more to simplify CI/CD. Additionally, we will provide comparisons of the wide variety of tools in the Kubernetes ecosystem for CI/CD, observability, storage and networking. We will also demonstrate how to use Helm and Draft.</p>

## Bio:

 - <p>Tommy Falgout grew up in the swamps of Louisiana, but knew his destiny was with technology. After graduating with a BS in CS from Tulane, his first job was developing a useless feature in the 90's called Text Messaging. After automating himself out of a job, he found his way to Yahoo for 9 years where he managed the Operational Database for all Servers, VMs and network equipment in Yahoo's datacenters. He's now a Cloud Solution Architect at Microsoft which means he's paid to draw boxes and lines with acronyms in them.</p>
