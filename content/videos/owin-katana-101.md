  "abstract": "<p>OWIN.ORG – “OWIN defines a standard interface between .NET web servers and web applications. The goal of the OWIN interface is to decouple server and application, encourage the development of simple modules for .NET web development, and, by being an open standard, stimulate the open source ecosystem of .NET web development tools.”\r\n</p><p>Katana – OWIN implementations for Microsoft servers and frameworks.\r\n</p><p>OWIN-based components is the future of .NET based web development. We had seen some hints in various talks around “vNext.” This talk is an introduction of OWIN and Katana; a mixture of code and concepts; how middleware are created, and chained together to create something called pipeline. Also, includes some introduction of how to’s; example: incorporate a popular framework, like Web API.</p>",
