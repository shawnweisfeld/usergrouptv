The goal of the OWIN interface is to decouple server and application, encourage the development of simple modules for .NET web development, and, by being an open standard, stimulate the open source ecosystem of .NET web development tools.”\r\n</p><p>Katana – OWIN implementations for Microsoft servers and frameworks.\r\n</p><p>OWIN-based components is the future of .NET based web development.
