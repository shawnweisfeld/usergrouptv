Is it possible to learn what what we need to learn in order to stay current and still have time for a life outside of work? It is! This presentation is about patterns you can apply to how and when you learn. My goal is to give you the ideas and techniques that will help you learn effectively and do so for your entire career - something you can use for 40 years! Attendees - bring your lists. Bring the list of stuff of you want to learn or think you should learn. Take a few minutes to write down the challenges you've had in 'keeping up'. We'll discuss some during the session and I'll be available afterward for one on one conversations for the rest!</p>",
