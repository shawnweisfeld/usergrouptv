## Abstract:



## Bio:

 - <p>J is a Senior Architect for Hitachi Consulting based in Houston, TX and absolutely loves to write code and build cool, innovative solutions to hard problems. J has been involved with the Houston .NET User's Group (HDNUG), one of the oldest and largest .NET-focused user groups in the US and you can join him at HDNUG on the second Thursday of every month. He also loves to ride his Kawasaki Concours 14. But he won't code and ride at the same time. That would be bad.</p>
