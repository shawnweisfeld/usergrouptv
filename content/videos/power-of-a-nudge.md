People’s choices are strongly influenced by the environment, and nudging is about creating an environment that helps people make better choices. In this interactive session we will learn how to nudge others to become more Agile. Create a toolset of strong nudges to take your team to the next level. Build subtle yet powerful nudges to improve team spirit and productivity. Explore nudge patterns and techniques, and practice different ways to lead by nudging. Nudge shorter and more productive meetings Nudge code base improvement by moving furniture Nudge better communication and more trust\"</p>",

I build large back-end systems that require high-performance and high-reliability, and process vast amounts of data. I believe that successful software is created by strong teams, requires good engineering practices, and evolves in close collaboration with the users. </p>",
