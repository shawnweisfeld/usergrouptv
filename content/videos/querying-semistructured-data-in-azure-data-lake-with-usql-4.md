Microsoft’s Azure Data Lake is a cloud storage and analytical service for parking a variety of data.  I have stored in Azure Data Lake Store several gigabytes of US Census data at a reasonable rate per month.  Now I can query that semi-structured data using an ANSI SQL language called U-SQL.  In this session I will demonstrate the similarities and differences between U-SQL and T-SQL.  I will demonstrate how easy it is to build a query against 21 GB of CSV files. Such queries can help you determine whether you have a gold mine in your data or a bunch of garbage before investing in a full data warehouse build.</p>",
