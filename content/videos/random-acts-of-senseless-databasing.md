## Speaker:

 - Kris Hokanson

## Abstract:

<p>After years of snake oil salesmen and good-meaning but part-time developers, Acme Oil & Gas company’s databases have become something Rube Goldberg would be proud of and they've hired you to sort everything out. What are some of the things you can expect to find and how can you fix them? From spaghetti code that references views inside of views nested in other views, to overly indexed tables that generate 10x the disk IO and contention they should, we’ll talk about database development, administration, and plenty of things in between.</p>

## Bio:

 - <p>Kris has been building databases for over 20 years. Since SQL Server 7 he’s been looking for ways to shave a second (or an hour) off any query he comes across. His work experience ranges from small construction firms to fortune 200 Oil & Gas corporations.  He has designed and administered everything from 10 MB single user databases to enterprise data warehouses using SQL Server and SSIS to consolidate data from hundreds of disparate ERP systems.
