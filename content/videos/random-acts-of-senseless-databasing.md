  "abstract": "<p>After years of snake oil salesmen and good-meaning but part-time developers, Acme Oil & Gas company’s databases have become something Rube Goldberg would be proud of and they've hired you to sort everything out. What are some of the things you can expect to find and how can you fix them?
