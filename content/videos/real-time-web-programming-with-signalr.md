## Abstract:

<p>Web programming has always been a one-way conversation; a client calls a server and the server sends a response. But what if you could go the other direction? What if your server could call your client directly? No more inefficient polling. No more waiting for the next server poll to get your data; the server sends it as soon as it has it. Using a variety of techniques behind the scenes to smooth over the rough edges of dealing with variously capable browsers and web servers, SignalR makes real-time client-server communication ridiculously easy. Come see how this new library opens up a ton of possibilities for interactive and collaborative web applications

## Bio:

 - <p>Brian Sullivan is a principal software engineer at Clear Measure in Dallas. He got his start in programming maintaining legacy mainframe applications in COBOL at a large trucking company, but quickly realized he needed to find a more productive environment in order to stay sane. He jumped at the opportunity to help transition some of those COBOL applications to .NET, and he hasnâ€™t looked back since. He has been working with Microsoft technologies since the .NET 1.0 days, and is interested in introducing modern web development techniques to the clients he works with. Brian is recipient of the Microsoft MVP award in ASP.NET and a graduate of Harding University.</p>
