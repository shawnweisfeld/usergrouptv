  "abstract": "<p>Web programming has always been a one-way conversation; a client calls a server and the server sends a response. But what if you could go the other direction? What if your server code could call Javascript methods on your client? That's what SignalR allows you to do. Come see how this new library opens up a ton of possibilities for interactive and collaborative web applications.</p>",

      "bio": "<p>Brian Sullivan is a principal software engineer at Clear Measure in Dallas. He got his start in programming maintaining legacy mainframe applications in COBOL at a large trucking company, but quickly realized he needed to find a more productive environment in order to stay sane. He jumped at the opportunity to help transition some of those COBOL applications to .NET, and he hasnâ€™t looked back since. He has been working with Microsoft technologies since the .NET 1.0 days, and is interested in introducing modern web development techniques to the clients he works with. Brian is recipient of the Microsoft MVP award in ASP.NET and a graduate of Harding University.</p>",
