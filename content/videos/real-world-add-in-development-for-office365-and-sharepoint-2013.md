## Abstract:

<p>Building Add-ins for Office 365 requires many new skills and knowledge. For those new to SharePoint and all SharePoint veterans, building add-ins and apps for Office 365 introduces a huge paradigm shift over the full-trust development model. Full-trust development is on its way out whether we like it or not. In this session, we will learn how to create real world add-ins and apps deployable on Office 365 and On-premise SharePoint 2013 and SharePoint 2016. Learn to build SharePoint-Hosted add-ins/apps and Provider-Hosted add-ins/apps that will leverage various Azure services to create robust solutions, including Azure Web Sites, Azure Web Jobs and more. We will demonstrate using AngularJS and Web Services to create useful and functional add-ins. The future is today. Donâ€™t pass up this opportunity to learn the skills and knowledge you need to build SharePoint Add-ins and App solutions for Office 365.
