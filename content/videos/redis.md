  "abstract": "<p>Redis (http://msopentech.com/opentech-projects/redis) is a very popular open-source, networked, in-memory, key-value data store. It is known for high performance, flexibility, a rich set of data structures, and a simple straightforward API. MS Open Tech has been working with the Redis community to build a production-ready Windows port of Redis, including 64-bit support, an installer for Windows Azure, NuGet support, and much more. In this talk we will discuss what it takes as a .NET Developer to work with Redis both on prem and in the cloud.</p>",
