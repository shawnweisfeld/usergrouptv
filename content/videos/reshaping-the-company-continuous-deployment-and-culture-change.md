## Speaker:

 - Gabriel Schenker

## Abstract:

<p>From the idea to the consumer as fast as possible, thatâ€™s what everybody these days wants. To help achieve this a company producing mission critical software needs to embrace continuous deployment and build up the corresponding deployment pipeline. But beware, that is not enough! To be successful a culture change throughout the company is needed. This include top management equally as any engineers working on the floor. In this talk I want to point out and discuss the most obvious areas affected and suggest possible steps on how to implement these changes.
