## Speaker:

 - Amir Rajan

## Abstract:

<p>Amir Rajan will show how you can use ASP.NET MVC to create REST Services and how to interact with these services from WP7. We'll go over what it "really" means to create a REST service (it's not just about serving up JSON and XML over http) and see how we can leverage these services to create mobile based applications. Amir will also show the interoperability benefits REST gives us by taking a look at how WP7 can communicate with a Ruby On Rails web application, and Rest API's provided by Twitter.</p>
