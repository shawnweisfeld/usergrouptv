We'll go over what it \"really\" means to create a REST service (it's not just about serving up JSON and XML over http) and see how we can leverage these services to create mobile based applications. Amir will also show the interoperability benefits REST gives us by taking a look at how WP7 can communicate with a Ruby On Rails web application, and Rest API's provided by Twitter.</p>",
