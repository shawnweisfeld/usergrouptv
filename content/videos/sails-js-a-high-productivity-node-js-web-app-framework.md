But out of the box, it doesn't include many of the convenient features modern web developers may be accustomed to. Sails.js aims to provide Ruby on Rails-level productivity for Node applications with features like scaffolding, a built-in ORM called Waterline, and easy support for real-time interaction. Come see how you can build apps for Node's cutting edge platform without giving up the features of your favorite web framework.</p>",

He got his start in programming maintaining legacy mainframe applications in COBOL at a large trucking company, but quickly realized he needed to find a more productive environment in order to stay sane. He jumped at the opportunity to help transition some of those COBOL applications to .NET, and he hasnâ€™t looked back since. He has been working with Microsoft technologies since the .NET 1.0 days, and is interested in introducing modern web development techniques to the clients he works with. Brian is recipient of the Microsoft MVP award in ASP.NET and a graduate of Harding University.</p>",
