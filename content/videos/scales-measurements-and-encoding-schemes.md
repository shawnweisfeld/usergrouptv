## Speaker:

 - Joe Celko

## Abstract:

<p>Programmers have learned how to design programs, but they haven't really thought about how to design data. First normal form requires that the columns in a table be scalar values. But how many database people actually know what a scale is or have any background in measurement theory? Likewise, how many people invent encoding schemes by simply numbering a list of values? This session should make you into a better database programmer.</p>

## Bio:

 - <p>Member of ANSI X3H2 Database Standards Committee for ten years, Author of Joe Celko series of books on SQL and databases for MKP/Elsevier. Author of over a dozen columns in the trade press in the US and Europe.</p>

## Recorded At:
