## Speaker:

 - Vince Blasberg

## Abstract:

<p>This meeting will focus on the Silverlight-HTML Bridge (JavaScript). We'll look at leveraging Silverlight user controls in an MVC 3 web application with jQuery. We'll see how to communicate between Silverlight and the browser in several different ways. The following list contains just a few reasons why we would want to use this often overlooked technology.</p>
<ul>
<li>Use Existing Rich Silverlight Controls</li>
<li>Share HTML and Silverlight Data using jQuery Web Service Calls</li>
<li>Continue to Develop Rich Web Applications in Compiled C#</li>
<li>Extend Silverlight using HTML Popup Windows</li>
<li>Incrementally Move to HTML 5 and CSS3</li>
</ul>
