  "abstract": "<p>This meeting will focus on the Silverlight-HTML Bridge (JavaScript). We'll look at leveraging Silverlight user controls in an MVC 3 web application with jQuery. We'll see how to communicate between Silverlight and the browser in several different ways. The following list contains just a few reasons why we would want to use this often overlooked technology.</p>\r\n<ul>\r\n<li>Use Existing Rich Silverlight Controls</li>\r\n<li>Share HTML and Silverlight Data using jQuery Web Service Calls</li>\r\n<li>Continue to Develop Rich Web Applications in Compiled C#</li>\r\n<li>Extend Silverlight using HTML Popup Windows</li>\r\n<li>Incrementally Move to HTML 5 and CSS3</li>\r\n</ul>",
