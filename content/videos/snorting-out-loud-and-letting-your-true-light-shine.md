## Speaker:

 - Margaret Dawson

## Abstract:

<p>When we were young, most of us were encouraged to “be ourselves” and find our passion. But somewhere along the path through puberty and to adulthood, our inner voice and external guidance vastly changed, and we find ourselves being criticized for the very traits that make us unique and beautiful. Women leaders in technology perhaps face this more than other groups, and all of us have learned to navigate this world in different ways. Join Margaret Dawson, senior director of global product marketing at Red Hat, as she takes us on the journey of rediscovering her light, providing guidance and humor to help everyone remember not only what their inner light is but how to let it shine in spite of the critics and societal guidelines.</p>
