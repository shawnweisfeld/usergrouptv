  "abstract": "<p>After a hearty but tasteful round of \"yo momma\" jokes, this presentation reveals an overview of the NoSQL movement, what problems it is intended to solve, and an introduction of the CAP Theorem. A comparison of some of the more popular options such as CouchDB, MongoDB and Cassandra will be discussed. Attendees are invited to share their experiences with these technologies, and how these experiences differ from the more common relational approach to data.</p>",

      "bio": "<p>Derek Lane is an Enterprise Architect at Thomson Reuters. He has worn various hats in his career including mentor, coach, architect, manager, developer, trainer, methodologist and all around cool guy. Derek is a contributor to various projects as author, presenter, committer, and technical reviewer. Derek is the Founder of both the Oklahoma City Java User Group (OKCJUG) and the Dallas/Fort Worth, Texas MicroJava User Group; and has been active as a member, presenter, and mentor for over two decades at various technology user groups across the Midwest and Southern US. Derek can on occasion be found utilizing his background in engineering, Virtual Reality and 3D graphics to think in four or more dimensions - some of which have yet to be independently verified. When not exploring the mind numbing edge of technology, he can be found listening to Bluegrass music and watching old Kung Fu movies - a dangerous combination from any point of view.</p>",
