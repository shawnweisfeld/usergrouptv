      "bio": "<p>My passion is helping nonprofits and small businesses manage their digital campaigns. These industries form the backbone of our society, they employ millions, and touch the lives of even more. They are also in the best position to use mobile and online marketing tools to create efficiencies and economies of scale that will help them compete and succeed. They also have the hardest time adopting new technologies given most of these enterprises are low on staff, time, and resources.
