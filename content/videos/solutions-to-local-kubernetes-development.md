Did you know there are several options for running a cluster locally? A locally running cluster provides the complete experience that you would have from a production-ready cluster. We are going to review these options, even including running a cluster using containers. By the end of the presentation, you should have at least one solution to leverage to gain Kubernetes experience.\r\n",
