  "abstract": "<p>\r\n\tEvery industry has a governing body or standard that requires some layer of security to your data. In my travels I have come to realize that when someone mentions security, DBA's tend to get frightened. This could be due to a lack of understanding of the requirements or not knowing what SQL Server offers to meet those requirements. In this session we will go over what SQL Server has to offer, Security Best Practices and how you can shrink your attack surface to meet Confidentiality, Integrity and Availability of your Servers and Data. In addition, attending this talk is worth 1.5 Continuing Education credits.\r\n</p>",
