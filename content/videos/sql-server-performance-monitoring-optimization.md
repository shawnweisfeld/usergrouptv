This session will cover ways in which attendees can monitor performance at various levels, and how they can use this information to optimize queries and improve overall application performance. We'll start with a discussion of developing a performance optimization strategy and how various tools can help. Then, we'll walk through the process of using SQL Profiler to collect data in a real-world case: Generating a 'hit list' of worst-performing queries based on execution times and frequency.</p><p>\r\nNext we'll look at using the Database Tuning Advisor to make suggestions related to physical database structures such as indexes and partitions. Also included will be ways in which built-in reports and dynamic management views can be used to monitor performance of production systems. Time permitting, the presentation will include methods for reducing deadlocks and managing long-running transactions. Finally, the presentation will include an overview of analyzing query plans. The overall emphasis will be on solving practical, real-world database performance problems.</p>",
