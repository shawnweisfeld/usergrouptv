  "abstract": "<p>Before SQL Server 2012, it was easy to develop several SSIS packages in a project and deploy each package as you complete it. However SQL Server 2012 introduces the project deployment model. With its awesome features comes the limitation that you can no longer deploy a single package. You must deploy the whole project every time! How do you deploy a project that contains a mix of deployed packages, ready to deploy packages and packages in development? In this session I demonstrate common problems that arise in the package development lifecycle that affect project deployment. I will then demonstrate how to use Team Foundation Server to address these problems. I will develop the story for handling packages at various stages of development using TFS.</p>",
