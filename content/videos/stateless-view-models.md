## Abstract:

<p>You've seen how to use MVVM Light to build stateful view models. You've used the message bus to synchronize that state among several view models. You saw how complex a solution can get. Now lets see a simpler alternative. Stateless view models don't need a message bus to keep data up to date. They track dependencies upon the model, and automatically update when that data changes. This simplifies your view model code by eliminating property changed notification, message publication, and state management. Stateless view models enable a powerful new set of patterns. In this session, we will explore some of those patterns, including: Linq projections, Selection model, Dynamic search and sort. This style of view model is made possible with the use of a dependency tracking framework. For this workshop, we will be using Update Controls, an open-source library available through NuGet.</p>

 - <p>Michael travels through space clinging to the carbon hull of a spherical ship made of molten iron. He commands an army of microorganisms which decompose the molecules that he captures to provide chemical energy for his cells. His mission is to increase entropy throughout the universe. Michael wrote The Art of Immutable Architecture, a book on applying mathematics to building distributed systems. Learn more at https://immutablearchitecture.com. In his spare time, he records Pluralsight courses on CQRS, XAML Patterns, Cryptography, and Provable Code. Formerly a Microsoft MVP for seven years. He maintains the spoon-bending Assisticant, Correspondence, and Jinaga open-source libraries. He shared videos about distributed systems at historicalmodeling.com. And he helps his clients at Improving benefit from the power of software mathematics. Software is math. Every class is a theorem. The compiler is the proof. And unit tests check our work.</p>
