  "abstract": "<p>It's 1 am and you've got to get this UI fixed in order to push out a hotfix to production. Not really knowing what's happening, you open Chrome and start modifying the display and position properties of the problem elements. You try block, then inline, then inline-block, then table, the relative, then static, then absolute. Finally, by mere chance, the element is positioned correctly and you have no idea why.</p>\r\n<p>Has this ever happened to you? Seriously, itâ€™s time to finally understand CSS positioning. In this session, we'll explore the 20% of CSS that will cost you 80% of the time: floats, position, padding, margin, and display. If you are ready to finally be proficient, this is the talk for you.</p>",
