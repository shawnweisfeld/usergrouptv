## Speaker:

 - Devlin Liles

## Abstract:

<p>You know the rules of TDD, rules are made to be broken. Do you have questions like: How do I use TDD to design my code? How much coverage is enough? How do I know when to cut bait and move on? Does TDD have to be slower than just writing code? How do I convince my manager that we need to use TDD? Come get sane answers to these questions!
