  "abstract": "<p>The school bell rang at 3:45 PM each afternoon, and I was typically walking in my plum painted front door by 5:00 PM Monday through Friday. I was a high school special education teacher, and had a two plus hour window of time each evening all to myself. My boyfriend, Andy, now my husband, did not get home from work until at least 7:00pm. In retrospect, this 10 plus hours a week was what paved the way for my blogging career. Let me back up a little, in October 2008 I bought my first house, a 1000 square foot, 2 story condo in Austin, TX. This was also the year I started my first real, post college job as a teacher. Cooking and I have never been that great friends, so I used my 2 hours each evening to attempt to turn my little house into a home on my teacher budget.</p>",
