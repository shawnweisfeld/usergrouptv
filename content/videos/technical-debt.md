      "bio": "<p>Computers have fascinated Glynn Brewer for as long as he can remember. Using them to solve business problems and streamline efficiencies that bring value to the business is both fun, challenging and very satisfying. I choose to major in Information Systems at the University of Houston so that I could turn my love of programming into a career. From there, I worked for AIG and Compaq (HP) before running a small software company for several years. After that and some consulting work, I went to work for an international services firm, moved to Los Angeles for a few years, and worked on several large projects. I learned many things while working there, among them a passion for Scrum and Agile software development.\r\n</p>",
