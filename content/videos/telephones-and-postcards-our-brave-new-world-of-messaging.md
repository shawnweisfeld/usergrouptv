  "abstract": "<p>\r\n    \r\nSo you've decided to try messaging. You've built distributed systems before - everyone's called a web service, right? You've looked at MSMQ, RabbitMQ, Azure Service Bus or ActiveMQ.\r\n  </p><p>\r\nBut where do these technologies fit in? How will working with asynchronous, durable messages change the way you build applications? And most importantly, what about the UI?\r\n  </p><p>\r\nLuckily for us, messaging is a problem already solved centuries ago. It's just up to us as developers to use real-world metaphors to guide the building of our systems. In this session, we'll look at telephones, postcards, magazines and more to see how messaging patterns perfected with human interaction can be leveraged in messaging systems.\r\n  </p><p>\r\nWe'll also look at complex processes and how organizations large and small can collaborate on complex tasks, and how we can model them in our systems.. Finally, we'll see where messaging sits in the overall space of distributed systems, where it fits and where it doesn't, just like we as humans have evolved our communication over the millenia.\r\n\r\n</p>",
