Now you won't have to worry about that anymore. In this session, I show you some little-known tricks, methods, and trace flags you can use to tune your backups just like you would with a query. You'll learn about the backup \"execution plan\" and how to access it. Understanding how to tune the individual portions of your backup process will allow you to knock 80% and even more off of your backup and restore time. I’m not holding anything back in this session. This is a method I’ve used for 15 years to tune my backups, and I’ve had great success.</p>",
