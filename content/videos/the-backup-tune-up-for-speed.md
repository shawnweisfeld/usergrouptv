## Abstract:

<p>Have you ever gotten tired of your database taking hours to back up? Are you sick of your users breathing down your neck because the database restore is taking too long? Now you won't have to worry about that anymore. In this session, I show you some little-known tricks, methods, and trace flags you can use to tune your backups just like you would with a query. You'll learn about the backup "execution plan" and how to access it. Understanding how to tune the individual portions of your backup process will allow you to knock 80% and even more off of your backup and restore time. I’m not holding anything back in this session. This is a method I’ve used for 15 years to tune my backups, and I’ve had great success.</p>
