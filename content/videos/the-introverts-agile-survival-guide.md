 - Ken Howard

## Abstract:

<p>According to best-selling author Susan Cain, introverts are often discriminated against in our extrovert- dominated society.  

Although approximately two thirds of people in the United States are considered extroverts, the majority of IT professionals are 

introverts.  Many Agile practices, however, tend to favor the extrovert, leaving introverts with a frequent feeling of being 

yanked outside their comfort zone.</p><p>Attending meetings, working in an open team room, and interacting with team members 

throughout the day can leave the introvert feeling exhausted and yearning for a quiet environment to think and be productive.  

The introvert may feel it’s necessary to become an extrovert to survive Agile, but not only is this unrealistic – it’s 

unnecessary. Introverts and extroverts are all welcome at this session.  We’ll cover strategies for introverts to increase their 

job satisfaction by expanding their comfort zone and how extroverts can increase empathy for the plight of their introverted team 

members.</p><h3>Objectives/Focus:</h3><ul><li>Understand behavioral and motivational differences between introverts and 

extroverts</li><li>Assess your level of introversion/extroversion</li><li>Learn success strategies when working on project teams 

mixed with intro/extroverts</li><li>Learn ways to adapt project best practices that tend to favor 

extroverts</li></ul>
