## Speaker:

 - Richard Seroter

## Abstract:

<p>The .NET renaissance is underway. .NET devs now have access to a growing community of open source projects that support resilient cloud-native web applications. In this meetup, we'll explore what to do with your existing .NET apps, discuss the new libraries you should care about, and review all the (new) ways to run .NET apps. Oh, and we'll probably have a demo or two.
