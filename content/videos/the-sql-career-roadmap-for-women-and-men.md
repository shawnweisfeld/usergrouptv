## Speaker:

 - Jennifer McCown

## Abstract:

<p>The ideal way to become a SQL Server professional is to get a degree, get a junior position, and then work your way up. But, the vast majority of data professionals don’t follow this path! Instead, most of us start out as "accidental DBAs" and fumble our way into a full time data career. This is not ideal, and we could all use some help navigating through resumes, job hunting, interviews, and negotiating. You’ll learn about all that in this session. We will also talk about how to get around a big obstacle for both women and men: how to get back to work after a long period of not working. How can I get a database job with no experience? What’s the best way to learn the newest technology? What resources are out there? Bring your questions, and we’ll explore the answers.</p>
