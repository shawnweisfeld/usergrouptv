  "abstract": "<p>The human brain has evolved countless ways in its existence over millions of years...but what if some of those evolutionary moments led to what we refer to today as ‘unconscious bias’? In this session, you will better understand what occurs in our brains as we explore the building blocks of implicit cognition and unconscious behaviors – both of which can interfere with a productive and inclusive workplace. This cognitive deep-dive explains how bias works its way into every major arm of your organization, and will arm you with tactics to spot and disrupt these potentially damaging behaviors as they occur in yourself and others.</p>",
