  "abstract": "<p>XAML gives us two-way data binding: view to view model. But how do you synchronize data between phones and tablets? Learn how to data bind to the cloud. When a change is made on one device, the change appears on another. Data flows seamlessly across devices.But those devices aren't always connected. And even when they are, users don't want to wait for a network connection before they can see or work with their data. So data needs to be stored locally, and synchronized in the background.Build a universal app where the phone and tablet share a common data model. That model is synchronized through a cloud service and into local storage. Project that storage through the view model, and data bind it to the view.</p>",

He commands an army of microorganisms which decompose the molecules that he captures to provide chemical energy for his cells. His mission is to increase entropy throughout the universe. Michael wrote The Art of Immutable Architecture, a book on applying mathematics to building distributed systems. Learn more at https://immutablearchitecture.com. In his spare time, he records Pluralsight courses on CQRS, XAML Patterns, Cryptography, and Provable Code. Formerly a Microsoft MVP for seven years. He maintains the spoon-bending Assisticant, Correspondence, and Jinaga open-source libraries. He shared videos about distributed systems at historicalmodeling.com. And he helps his clients at Improving benefit from the power of software mathematics. Software is math. Every class is a theorem. The compiler is the proof. And unit tests check our work.</p>",
