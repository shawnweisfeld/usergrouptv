  "abstract": "<p>If you're doing any iOS development currently or plan on starting in the near future you'll realize the iOS world is a big transition with it's own sub-culture and dedicated community.  Luckily you won't be left on your own with a text editor and command line compiler, as there are numerous tools and gems that the community has created that will help you code better and faster. In this talk I'll go over all the great tools out there to do iOS development more efficiently, like unit-testing, graphics, networking, source control, (better) code-completion, resources and more.\r\n</p>",
