Luckily you won't be left on your own with a text editor and command line compiler, as there are numerous tools and gems that the community has created that will help you code better and faster. In this talk I'll go over all the great tools out there to do iOS development more efficiently, like unit-testing, graphics, networking, source control, (better) code-completion, resources and more.\r\n</p>",
