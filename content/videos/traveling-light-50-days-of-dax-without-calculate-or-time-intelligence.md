  "abstract": "CALCULATE and Time Intelligence functions have long been considered cornerstones of DAX. However, recent thinking spurred by MS MVP Greg Deckler posits that DAX is better off without either of these. Brian Julius and Mike Ford will discuss their experience completing Curbal's two \"25 Days of DAX\" exercises under these constraints. They will address issues including ease of measure creation, transparency and maintenance, performance, learning curve, and automation considerations.",
