There are a number of traditional ways. Those ways usually have problems with how to handle data spikes, durability, and distribution for processing. Azure Event Hubs may be an answer to part of those problems. We will go over what they are, how to set them up, the costs, and the various ways to send and receive information. </p>",

He has over 25 years of experience working in Information Technology. During that time he has done everything from running network cable, setting up various companies infrastructure from the absolute bare metal, and building line of business software for many of those companies. As passionate as he is about technology, you might happen to see him checking his air reserve while at a depth of 60 feet, cooking up a mean “free-range” fruit cake, doing pre-show table magic at the improv, or making a nice piece of wood into a lot of\r\nsawdust so my wife will have potting bench for her plants.</p>",
