## Abstract:

<p>Hate writing JavaScript? Wish it was strongly typed, scalable, and had better tool support? TypeScript is a typed superset of JavaScript that compiles to plain JavaScript. Any browser. Any host. Any OS. Open Source. 
</p><p>
In this session we will introduce TypeScript and show the basics of getting started with it today, including how to leverage your existing arsenal of third party JavaScirpt libraries like jQuery.</p>
