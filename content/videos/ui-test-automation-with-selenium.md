  "abstract": "<p>Say “UI Test Automation” while playing a word association game and  the other party will inevitably say “Hard!”. And yet without the UI tests your safety net is never complete, and manual testing of UIs on Firefox, Chrome and various flavors of IE will slow down your development. As we discovered UI tests are not hard, they just require a shift in mindset.<br />\r\nIn this session, you will learn Selenium WebDriver C# API and design patterns to write reliable tests. We will show how to distribute tests across multiple VMs. And to wrap up you will learn to design your test classes in a Fluent fashion that will make your developers and QA department excited about UI test automation. At the end the group will be rewarded by a sight of a mouse and keyboard working by themselves, testing the UI automatically while we are relaxing with a pizza.</p>",

      "bio": "Ian Henehan is a Senior Consultant at Improving Enterprises. He got his start doing electrical and control design for LCD manufacturing machines. He eventually joined the Intel Architecture Labs as an integration and test engineer, building a wide array of specialized test equipment and software. This experience led to an interest in team process and how to minimize the friction it can create for producing results. A three year stint with the Educational Technology group at Texas Instruments allowed him to concentrate on test frameworks and integration with build systems. This resulted in a broader understanding of the problem space that available frameworks tried to solve and also building a couple new tool sets from scratch. Since joining Improving, he has had the opportunity to continue work in this area and gets to design  tools for highly integrated build, test and deployment solutions.",
