However, there’s nothing that shows you how to tie them all together to make your software fast, testable, and flexible.  This talk will go over my toolset: MSTest, Moq – Mocking framework, NCover – for coverage, MSBuild – for automation, Unity – for dependency injection. This talk will have a lot of code… a lot. You will come away with a stronger appreciation of how unit testing will improve the quality of your software.</p>",
