I learned how to utilize a WebView inside a .NET MAUI application to wrap any sort of web app I desired (Angular, React, Vue, you name it!) and deploy it with the power of MAUI to any platform under the sun. I’m excited to show you how to do this — bridging two worlds has never been more fun!\r\n\r\n",
