We spend so much time focusing on the backend of development and ignoring the part that potentially impacts users the most. By applying just a few simple design principles, we can begin to create a user experience that is easier to use and gives a high-quality feel to our software. In this session, we will discuss a variety of design principles that will stretch our brains and take our software to the next level.\r\n</p>",
