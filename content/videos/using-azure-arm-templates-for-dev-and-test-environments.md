  "abstract": "<p>There are a lot of perceived hurdles around moving your production environments to Azure. But when we consider Dev/Test environments, it’s often a different story. \r\nWe’ll talk about some of the benefits to moving your Dev/Test into Azure. The various different pieces of your infrastructure that you could move, and more importantly how to take a hybrid approach, so you can use Azure resources for some things, and on-premise infrastructure for others. \r\nFinally we’ll dive down into some of the technical guts around the tooling and concepts you can use to make this work for you. How to use Azure Resource Groups and environment templates to streamline this process; “Lift-and-shift” approaches; automated deployment options; and much more. </p>",
