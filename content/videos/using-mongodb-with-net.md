They are all a part of this informative talk about when and how to best use MongoDB from a .NET application. We will answer these questions: When is MongoDB the right fit for my application? How does MongoDB performance compare with a relational databases? What are the best MongoDB query patterns for my .NET Application? I’ve heard that MongoDB is productive and easy by not reliable. How secure, reliable, compliant, scalable and performant is MongoDB? I thought MongoDB was is for dynamic languages on a Linux stack. Does it work well on and Windows and with .NET? I’ve heard that MongoDB clustering is hard to set up. Are there hosted service offerings that take care of this for me? We’ll also talk about how ThermoFisher uses MongoDB to reduce scientific experiment times by an order of magnitude and some interesting applications that are making the world cleaner, safer and healthier.\r\n\r\n</p>",
