Knowing how to use the Compiler API can, however, may seem like a daunting task. In this session, I'll demonstrate a number of real-world examples that use the Compiler API to provide useful functionality and features via analyzers, refactorings, and .NET Core tools. You'll see how straightforward this API is, and you'll understand how to apply it in your own applications.",
