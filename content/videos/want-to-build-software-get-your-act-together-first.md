## Speaker:

 - Claudio Lassala

## Abstract:

<p>
Software developers are supposed to create applications that make people's life easier, automating tedious tasks, encouraging users to get their work done, organizing complex workflows into digestible information and actions, helping them separate the most important information from the least important. But still, most developers forget to automate their own boring tasks. We forget to organize our information. We sometimes use tools that do not help us get our work done.
</p><p>
So how can we build software that fits our client needs, if we don't understand those needs ourselves?
</p><p>
This session is NOT about software development; this session is about things we can do and tools we can use to organize ourselves, so we can free up our minds to more important things. Tools covered in this session include (but not limited to) Evernote, application launchers, screen capture tools, tablets, smartphones, etc.
