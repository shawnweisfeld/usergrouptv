  "abstract": "<p>React pioneered the component based frontend and revolutionized how we think about building a web application. Let’s leverage the patterns we learned from React with the latest web primitives and see if we can #UseThePlatform to build a better web. We’ll discuss how to simplify your application while we compare React to Web Components with Google Polymer. As mobile becomes the dominant experience, we'll see why now more than ever initialization time & overall performance matters. Lastly, you’ll get to hear how Comcast is building its next generation single page apps for millions of customers using the latest browser APIs, Redux and Web Components with Google Polymer. You’ll walk away from this talk feeling motivated and empowered to simplify your architecture.</p>",
