      "bio": "<p>Clark Sell is a Developer Evangelist for Microsoft. Name a role in the software industry, and Clark has probably played it. He started as a Y2K tester and has since worked as a developer, lead, \"build monkey\", solutions architect and product manager. His professional sweet spot however, lies in designing and building software solutions that make life easier - there&rsquo;s no chance for boredom and constant opportunities for growth. Clark is MCSD certified and received top Microsoft honors with the Circle of Excellence Award. He&rsquo;s a graduate of Western Illinois University and before joining Microsoft in 2005, he served as a solutions architect at Allstate Insurance Company. As a senior developer evangelist and Visual Studio team system ranger, Clark brings a good dose of humor and a zest for life to the podium. You can hear Clark&rsquo;s technical musings on \"The Smackdown\" at DeveloperSmackdown.com and The Thirsty Developer Podcast - or find him getting grease under his nails in the garage. Clark&rsquo;s a muscle car fanatic who&rsquo;s currently finishing a body-off restoration of his 1970 Chevrolet Camaro while driving his 1968 Camaro SS.</p>",
