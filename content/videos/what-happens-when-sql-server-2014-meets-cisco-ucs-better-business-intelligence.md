During this session we will be discussing key differentiators that place Cisco well ahead of the competition. Learn about UCS’ management model, Service Profiles, Service Profile Templates, Virtual Interface Adapters, and how they all can help to simplify and standardize SQL Server deployments. We will also discuss how these differentiators can help to drastically reduce deployment and recovery times, and how UCS provides the best of class hardware platform that can help to achieve the highest levels of consolidation and performance for both virtual and bare metal SQL Server implementations.</p>",
