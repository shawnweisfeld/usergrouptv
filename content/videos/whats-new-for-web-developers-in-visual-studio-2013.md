 - Brian Sullivan

## Abstract:

<p>The web ships fast, but Microsoft developers have usually had to wait two to three years for updates to their tools. That's starting to change as the ASP.NET team ramps up its release cadence, with new features coming every few months. As exciting as it is, all that new stuff can be hard to keep up with. Come get an update on the latest web technologies from Microsoft as Brian explores the new features for web developers in Visual Studio 2013. This will be a whirlwind tour; we'll cover everything from OWIN and the Katana project to Entity Framework 6 updates and the new ASP.NET Identity model.</p>

## Bio:

 - <p>Brian Sullivan is a principal software engineer at Clear Measure in Dallas. He got his start in programming maintaining legacy mainframe applications in COBOL at a large trucking company, but quickly realized he needed to find a more productive environment in order to stay sane. He jumped at the opportunity to help transition some of those COBOL applications to .NET, and he hasnâ€™t looked back since. He has been working with Microsoft technologies since the .NET 1.0 days, and is interested in introducing modern web development techniques to the clients he works with. Brian is recipient of the Microsoft MVP award in ASP.NET and a graduate of Harding University.</p>
