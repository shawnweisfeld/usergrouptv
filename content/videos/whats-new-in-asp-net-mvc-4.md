## Abstract:

<p>ASP.NET MVC has come a long way from its initial release in 2009. Its feature set and maturity have grown by leaps and bounds with each release, and the new fourth version is no exception. In this presentation, we'll cover some of the new features, including the ASP.NET Web API, display modes, mobile enhancements, bundling and minification, and asynchronous controllers. You'll come away with an understanding of what the new framework version offers, and why you might want to upgrade your existing MVC apps to the latest and greatest.</p>

## Bio:

 - <p>Brian Sullivan is a principal software engineer at Clear Measure in Dallas. He got his start in programming maintaining legacy mainframe applications in COBOL at a large trucking company, but quickly realized he needed to find a more productive environment in order to stay sane. He jumped at the opportunity to help transition some of those COBOL applications to .NET, and he hasnâ€™t looked back since. He has been working with Microsoft technologies since the .NET 1.0 days, and is interested in introducing modern web development techniques to the clients he works with. Brian is recipient of the Microsoft MVP award in ASP.NET and a graduate of Harding University.</p>
