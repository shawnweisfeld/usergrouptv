## Abstract:

<p>Released just a few weeks ago (March 7, 2017, along with new version of VS), C# 7 brings some new and interesting features; like tuple, pattern matching, etc.  In this talk, I shall ‘show and tell’ some of these new features [with code examples], as well as few interesting ones that didn’t make the final cut. Sample code at https://github.com/reazhaq/CSharp7</p>
