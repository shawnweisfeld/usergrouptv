Windows Azure now supports persistent VMs that can be updated and persisted to Windows Azure blob storage. This means that many existing on-premise applications can easily be migrated to Windows Azure. Also, Microsoft recently announced that they are extending Windows Azure’s reach into a PaaS platform with Windows Azure Web Sites. Windows Azure Web Sites is a simple and powerful hosting platform that allows developers to easily build and rapidly deploy web applications on Windows Azure using their favorite languages, frameworks, and tools.\r\n\r\nIn this presentation, I will demonstrate how to quickly build and deploy applications using the new Windows Azure features and services including Virtual Machines and Windows Azure Web Sites",
