  "abstract": "<p>How does Agile fit into your company's strategic plan? Often, companies attempt Agile without understanding the impact Agile will have on the three components that are core to the operation of their companies: Business Strategy, The Operating Model, Execution. When this happens, there are breakdowns in the operation which are evidenced by failed \"Agile\" projects, failed implementations, and frequently \"Agile fatigue\". Moreover, executives are not aligned with the VALUE of Agile that enables companies to become marketplace leaders and dominate their competition. In this session, you'll learn: \r\nThe foundations of Business Strategy, Operating Models, and Execution, The integrated relationship between Agile and Strategy, How Agile and Agile Operating Models work within this context, How to describe to Executives the impact of Agile to fix a broken Operating Model. You'll walk away with a new language so that you can articulate Agile as it relates to Operational Strategy. Moreover, you'll have tools to blend Agile into your operating model so that executives want to get more from your Agile transformation, or even better... build better products that your customers will love and at a workplace that your teams will enjoy.</p>",
