## Speaker:

 - Rick Lowe

## Abstract:

<p>SQL Server is a huge product, with many different places a DBA can go to look for information on how the server is performing. So many in fact that they can often overlap, which sometimes makes it hard to understand why tackling a new tool is worth the effort. In this installment of Rick's "Why should I care" series, he lays out a case for why working knowledge of the plan cache is critical for performance tuning efforts in real world environments. A review of relevant views and functions is included for the (newly?) motivated audience. Perfect for those who are relatively new to performance tuning concerns, or advanced DBAs trying to figure out how to have a similar conversation with their less experienced peers, or developers who are curious as to why their DBAs drink in the morning (allegedly). This is not a deep dive into the cache, it really is primarily a session exploring _why_ these DMOs are worth slogging through.</p>

## Bio:

 - <p>Rick is a Microsoft Certified Master with more than 15 years of experience working with SQL Server. He currently works as an independent performance DBA/Developer for clients across the USA and Canada. He started his career as a database developer, but over time became more and more interested in how the database engine operated ... eventually becoming more focused on operational and performance issues than code.Rick will work with all things relational, but most enjoys helping smaller companies get better performance from MSSQL, as well as smoothing over relationships between DBA and development teams.</p>
