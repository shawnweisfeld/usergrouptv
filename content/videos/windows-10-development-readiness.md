## Abstract:

<p>Windows 10 is here. Within 2-3 years, it’ll be on 1 Billion devices. Are you ready? Joseph Reynolds will provide information about what you need to know, as a developer, to take advantage of the over 2500 new platform features. This will be focused on introducing the new concepts of Windows 10 – and will be a fairly high level course.
