Joseph Reynolds will provide information about what you need to know, as a developer, to take advantage of the over 2500 new platform features. This will be focused on introducing the new concepts of Windows 10 – and will be a fairly high level course. We will look at some code, but it won’t be a coding-heavy course, so if you’re a business user wanting some information on Windows 10 and what it can do for your brand, come on over!\r\n</p>",
