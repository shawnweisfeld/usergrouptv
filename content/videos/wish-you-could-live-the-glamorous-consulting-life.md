## Speaker:

 - Juan Soto

## Abstract:

<p>Learn how to launch your career as a consultant, from how to get leads to call you, how to close the sale and what to charge for your services. A must see session if youâ€™re ready to make the plunge!Consulting is a great career choice, from the increased pay, (sometimes less), to the flexible hours, (working nights and weekends), you will work with a wide range of customers, (if you can find them), that will lead you to wonder why you didn't start earlier? (and walk away from a cushy job).I would not trade my consulting career for any other choice, I love the rewards and the freedom it provides me, but I've learned the hard way.I will share how I close $25,000 deals over the phone, how to get your lead to say yes and how to overcome price objections. 
In this session you will learn sales, marketing and management strategies to get your practice off the ground, sand traps to avoid along the way and a honest, down to earth assessment of the consulting life.</p>
