A typical worker in the United States switches jobs ever 4-5 years and in the tech industry it is even shorter. Due to this there is an even greater need now to improve the quality of the code you write and / or maintain in your job as a software developer. In this session, we will discuss what it means to improve the quality of the code and how you can work towards improving it every day. Also we will go over a few practical tips you can start using today to improve the quality of your code.</p>",
