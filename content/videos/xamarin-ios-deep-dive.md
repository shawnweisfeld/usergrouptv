## Abstract:

<p>This month's talk is a whirlwind tour through how Xamarin marries the worlds of C# and Objective-C. In this talk we will explore the basics of Objective-C and Cocoa Touch and how the Xamarin.iOS runtime and bindings map to C#. You will learn how delegates work, how memory management works, and how to work around missing or incomplete bindings. You will also learn how to use Xamarin Studio to explore Xamarin's code and expand your knowledge on your own. </p>
