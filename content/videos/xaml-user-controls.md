  "abstract": "<p>Are we ready for some hands-on XAML user control development? Silverlight and WP7 are still moving fast with new features on the way with Mango, WP7 Toolkit Update, and Silverlight 5. We're still writing XAML based applications with unique user control requirements. In this next meeting, we'll all be developing a few user controls in the three major XAML environments; WPF, SL4, and WP7. To get the most out of this meeting, please bring a laptop with Visual Studio 2010 installed with at least one of these environments ready. We'll move at a pace more like the Hands-On-Coding user group for the entire group to code and experiment with user controls. Here are some questions that we'll discuss before we start writing code. What's the difference between: Data Template and a Control Template, User Control and a Custom Control, ContentControl and ContentPresenter, ContentControl and ItemsControl, ItemsControl and ListBox, Styles and Control Templates, Databinding and TemplateBinding. When should we style, subclass, or apply a template to our controls? This meeting will give us more understanding of XAML user controls and how to best develop them in different situations.</p>",
