<h2 id="the-rig">The Rig</h2>
<p>So you saw us out recording an event, and are interested in how we record a user group meeting or conference.</p>
<p>Our goal when we do recordings it to capture a high quality recording of the presenter’s computer and the presenters voice. We don’t worry about recording video of the presenter’s face (however that is possible with some additional equipment and a camera operator).</p>
<ul>
<li>Option 1 – Software on the presenter’s computer. This option is the least expensive, however it requires the presenter to run software on their computer. If you choose this option, we recommend using an external microphone to improve the audio quality of the recording. NOTE: if you are a Microsoft MVP you can obtain a free copy of TechSmith’s Camtasia Studio you can email them at <a href="mailto:Evangelist@Techsmith.com">
Evangelist@Techsmith.com

</a>.</li>
<li>Option 2 – Hardware that captures the signal from the presenter’s computer on its way to the projector. This allows for zero impact on the presentation, however it is not cheap. This is the option we choose. I have been through a number of versions of &ldquo;the rig&rdquo; and this is what I am using today.</li>
</ul>
<p>The core is a <a href="https://www.epiphan.com/products/pearl/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">
Epiphan Pearl
&nbsp;<i class="fas fa-external-link-alt"></i>

</a>. I am currently using the original Pearl. I like this unit because it has VGA, HDMI and SDI in, allowing for a simple connection from all types of presenter’s computers. The original pearl also has a display port out so with a simple dongle you get HDMI and VGA out also, allowing for an easy connection to most projectors. The Pearl will also allow you to scale the recording to ensure that regardless of what resolution the presenter sends you have the right resolution for your projectors. This takes care of the video portion.</p>
<p>For audio I use a FiFine wireless lav microphone or a Zoom H1 Portable Recorder.</p>
<p>You will also need a few cables. Of course an HDMI and VGA cable (the Pearl actually comes with a set).</p>
<p>I also purchased a wireless repeater/router/ap. To manage the advanced features of the Pearl there is a wired network adapter, I wire this into the wireless so that I can connect via wifi. Having the multi-mode wifi device I can stich multiple rigs together so that they are all on the same wifi network, allowing for easier management during a larger event.</p>
<p>You will also need power.  I like traveling with a typical household power strip and a 6-foot extension cord.</p>
<p>For venues that don’t have a table for me to put the Pearl on I have purchased a small portable table, to keep my investment off of the floor.</p>
<p>NOTE: If you want to capture the presenters face Epiphan sells a <a href="https://www.epiphan.com/products/lumio12x" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">
pan/tilt/zoom camera
&nbsp;<i class="fas fa-external-link-alt"></i>

</a> designed to connect to the pearl for this task.</p>
