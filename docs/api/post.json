But unfortunately, there still are and always will be dramatic differences in skill levels of developers and their abilities to make important high-level design decisions. And while many proficient developers have adopted agile methods, wider adoption of agile processes and techniques will lead back to the division of labor that separated architects from developers to begin with.

DevOps teams may soon find that their initial effort, as effective as it was, does not scale consistently or quickly. After all it was only a proof of concept. This inability to scale slows the momentum created by the early successes.

I was working on a project that spanned multiple companies with my friend and colleague, John Field, who's a security architect at EMC, now Pivotal. At the time, we were working on a process to migrate legacy COBOL apps from running on their native IBM z/Series mainframe platform to run on top of open systems architectures, i.e. Linux. These were massive programs with millions of lines of code, built over decades. Their conversion processes required mimicking the mainframe's legendary security controls onto Linux platforms, using what was available to us via native and non-native security controls. This meant dealing with a multitude of security concerns across every tier of the system and into many of its sub-layers as well. Mandatory access controls were enforced on every node in the system. Linux systems had to be hardened to the nth degree and at the same time, multiple grains of authorization were required within the platform layers. Fortunately, everything we needed to do all this was already readily available and usable, and easily found within the public domain. Only open, established, and timeworn practices were being targeted. That is, technologies released under permissible licenses, like the Apache software license, and these things were allowed into the final design. Our problem wasn't with how to design the security system, per se, nor how to build it. Strangely, those were the easy parts. The hard part for us was how do we convey the contents of its complex design to others in a way that is understandable? Because, many of us are not, shall we say, security afflicted, so despite recommending only best practices, their concepts remain arcane, complicated, and generally not known to the masses. To break through this complexity barrier, John and I borrowed an idea remembered from our youth, and that is those science textbooks that depict the human anatomy. You remember the ones that use translucent pages, each with a particular organ, all overlaying together comprising the comprehensive image of the human body, complete with all of its sub-systems? We thought this a good way to communicate our complicated security system design to others. We adapted this idea for our end-to-end security design layout. Each image corresponds with an individual security component contained within a typical web app from it's outer to innermost layers. What's unique about this particular talk is that it started with those initial visual images of a typical web security system architecture. Next, a test application was created to go along with those anatomy images. The test app mimicked a typical web system, complete with test pages, links, buttons, database tables, et cetera, all of which are under tight security controls of various types. The goal of the test app was to create a comprehensive tutorial demonstrating all of the pertinent security controls that were contained within the anatomy diagram. Finally, we added instructions to install, deploy, and run the test app and published it all to GitHub. The project is called The Apache Fortress Demo, and we used it in our live demos and it could also be used by anyone else who wants to try it out at home. During our live demos, we would simultaneously dissect and discuss the web system security functionality, switching between the Power Point slides visually depicting the images and into the concrete demo to show how it all worked in a live system.

Front-end frameworks built on JavaScript in particular are a driving force behind a lot of the energy across the community. While frameworks are all the rage, where does a CMS (Content Management System) fit into the picture for your organization, if at all? In today’s talk, whether you are a developer or a decision maker, I would like to make the case why you should consider adding Drupal CMS to your technology stack. You’ll learn that Drupal does not have to replace your favorite framework of choice, but rather can be a vital part of your content management strategy. Drupal has been one of the leading technologies in the enterprise CMS space for many years. A large share of the organizations using Drupal according to the 2017 Drupal Business Survey include Government & Public Administration and Healthcare & Medicine, Charities and Non-Profit industries. Additionally, huge brands like NBC, Turner, The Weather Channel, WWE also leverage Drupal today. We will look through case studies across some of these verticals to see if Drupal could be the right fit for your organization. In our session we are going to dive into the features of Drupal to show the power and flexibility behind how it manages content models. We’ll talk through the history in how we transitioned over the years from thinking in terms of content living on “web page” to now managing content across many channels (Twitter/Mobile/Chatbot/Alexa/etc.). I’ll make the case for why Drupal is uniquely positioned to serve content to create today’s “Omnichannel” experiences. Finally, we will look at technologies like REST, JSON API, GraphQL which expose content to other frameworks and systems. We’ll look at distributions like Acquia Reservoir and Contenta which make it easier for developers new to Drupal to onramp to this platform. Whether you are working at a Government agency, University, digital agency, or other industry I want you to come away with an understanding for how Drupal can serve as your organization’s “Content Hub.”</p>","PostDate":"2017-10-06T16:20:55","Id":107,"Mp4Video":"http://player.vimeo.com/external/238049208.hd.mp4?s=c96137e62681b7d12a04e1408003fa9fddc8a836&profile_id=174&oauth2_token_id=20985841","Mp4VideoLow":"http://player.vimeo.com/external/238049208.sd.mp4?s=a7d0134b51b27c6c033290c0f4c81b6b6dc5ca12&profile_id=164&oauth2_token_id=20985841","OgvVideo":"","Speakers":[{"name":"Jay Callicott","slug":"jay-callicott"}],"Groups":[{"name":"Little Rock Tech Fest","slug":"little-rock-tech-fest"}],"Tags":[{"name":"Drupal","slug":"drupal"}]},{"Title":"From Turing to Big Data: A Look at Computing and Analytics","Url":"https://usergroup.tv/videos/from-turing-to-big-data-a-look-at-computing-and-analytics/","Thumbnail":"https://i.vimeocdn.com/video/660638605_295x166.jpg","Excerpt":"<p>A look at where computing and analytics began and where it is headed.\r\nThe basis of all DevOps and development starts with our measurements.

We have our core component library which we can sandbox and experiment with in React Storybook. We can test our components thoroughly here in *multiple browsers* to check compatibility and function. Then we assemble our components in a react app, where we implement another level of unit and functional testing. Our react app has very specific goals, which we can acceptance test through WebdriverIO (Selenium). All of this can run in the background *and* on a continuous integration server as part of our build process so we can continually iterate on our code without fear of introducing breaking changes. This tight feedback loop is key for pursuing continuous deployment and rapid delivery of code and allows us to go further with greater confidence than before. In this talk, we will walk through some tooling and explore examples of how you can implement continuous testing in your delivery lifecycle using thing like React, Redux, Storybook, Mocha, Jest, WebdriverIO, Selenium, and GO

To accomplish this, a new infrastructure was built within Windows – the Windows Subsystem for Linux (WSL) – upon which runs a genuine Ubuntu user-mode image provided by our great partners over at Canonical, creators of Ubuntu Linux.</p>","PostDate":"2016-05-31T11:11:39","Id":170,"Mp4Video":"http://player.vimeo.com/external/169070813.hd.mp4?s=555afdd1c0141eeeb3445d56d442c58f7c7a5bf6&profile_id=174&oauth2_token_id=20985841","Mp4VideoLow":"http://player.vimeo.com/external/169070813.sd.mp4?s=4abb29c765ae5abec01f350609e501cb4d981e4b&profile_id=165&oauth2_token_id=20985841","OgvVideo":"","Speakers":[{"name":"Dustin Kirkland","slug":"dustin-kirkland"}],"Groups":[{"name":"Austin Microsoft Developers Group","slug":"austin-microsoft-app-developers"}],"Tags":[{"name":"Bash","slug":"bash"}]},{"Title":"Automated Browser Testing From The Trenches ","Url":"https://usergroup.tv/videos/automated-browser-testing-from-the-trenches/","Thumbnail":"https://i.vimeocdn.com/video/581848094_295x166.jpg","Excerpt":"<p>Automated browser testing is historically difficult, buggy, fragile, and slow.

So many in fact that they can often overlap, which sometimes makes it hard to understand why tackling a new tool is worth the effort. In this installment of Rick's \"Why should I care\" series, he lays out a case for why working knowledge of the plan cache is critical for performance tuning efforts in real world environments. A review of relevant views and functions is included for the (newly?) motivated audience. Perfect for those who are relatively new to performance tuning concerns, or advanced DBAs trying to figure out how to have a similar conversation with their less experienced peers, or developers who are curious as to why their DBAs drink in the morning (allegedly).

Both platforms share many similar services but have critical differences that are important to understand. More and more cloud consumers are looking to build applications that are 'cloud portable' due to a general 'fear of commitment' to one cloud platform over another and as part of a larger HA/DR strategy. This desire to embrace more than one cloud platform is one that, as trusted technical advisors, we cannot afford to ignore. In this session, geared specifically toward cloud architects, Casey Watson, Senior Program Manager with the Azure Customer Advisory Team at Microsoft, discusses an approach to building complex, distributed applications that can be deployed to multiple cloud providers, take advantage of PaaS services and are easy to maintain. Casey will begin the session by discussing the key differences between the two cloud providers and offer some tips for having a multi-cloud conversation with your customers. Next, he will walk the audience through a multi-cloud architecture highlighting key platform differences then dive deep into Visual Studio to show how an actual, real-world solution would be implemented. Finally, Casey will review the deployment of a multi-cloud solution. After this session, you will be able to explain to your customers how to implement a solution that spans multiple clouds, articulate the key differences between Azure and AWS, and help customers decide upon the optimal cloud architecture that meets their business requirements.</p>","PostDate":"2017-07-20T14:05:46","Id":230,"Mp4Video":"http://player.vimeo.com/external/229767458.hd.mp4?s=a84e33d0be887caefadff07eecb818d8b1e2feb9&profile_id=175&oauth2_token_id=20985841","Mp4VideoLow":"http://player.vimeo.com/external/229767458.sd.mp4?s=d7163ec38899e4c4b52cd74f9312db11cb1fba20&profile_id=164&oauth2_token_id=20985841","OgvVideo":"","Speakers":[{"name":"Casey Watson","slug":"casey-watson"}],"Groups":[{"name":"Tulsa School of Dev","slug":"tulsa-school-of-dev"}],"Tags":[{"name":"Azure","slug":"azure"},{"name":"AWS","slug":"aws"}]},{"Title":"Cross Platform .NET","Url":"https://usergroup.tv/videos/cross-platform-net/","Thumbnail":"https://i.vimeocdn.com/video/650632322_295x166.jpg","Excerpt":"<p>Building on the momentum from the past couple years, ASP.NET Core has officially released and it is breathing new life into the .NET web development ecosystem.

I say “near” because it won’t always derive the perfect fill factor, but will get you close. We will look closely at the T-SQL for this technique to see how the proof of concept was developed for a very active OLTP database. I’ve observed a decrease in overall database wait times of 30% after the tuning. The tuning is continuous and allows for changes in data skew as well as evolving application interactions with the database.

What if you could simply document the file structure and then generate the ETL from the document? To demonstrate such an approach, I build an Excel file describing US census data that has more than 300 columns of fixed width data.  After demonstrating how this file communicates to business users, I will generate an SSIS package from that metadata using BIML Script.  Then I will also look at how you can generate a SQL Server bulk insert format file from the same metadata.

Early big data solutions in the Hadoop ecosystem assumed that data sizes overwhelmed available memory, emphasizing heavy disk usage to coordinate work between nodes. As the cost of memory decreases and the amount of memory available per server increases, we see a shift in the makeup of big data systems, emphasizing heavy memory usage instead of disk. Apache Spark, which focuses on memory-intensive operations, has taken advantage of this hardware shift to become the dominant solution for problems requiring distributed data. In this talk, we will take an introductory look at Apache Spark. We will review where it fits in the Hadoop ecosystem, cover how to get started and some of the basic functional programming concepts needed to understand Spark, and see examples of how we can use Spark to solve issues when analyzing large data sets.</p>","PostDate":"2020-02-08T16:27:50","Id":332,"Mp4Video":"http://player.vimeo.com/external/390483472.hd.mp4?s=15ce8653bd588d60624e973c7115b926dc5eb171&profile_id=175&oauth2_token_id=20985841","Mp4VideoLow":"http://player.vimeo.com/external/390483472.sd.mp4?s=8581ddc007a1a342e2a3702ac9c622c01117f0f1&profile_id=165&oauth2_token_id=20985841","OgvVideo":"","Speakers":[{"name":"Kevin Feasel","slug":"kevin-feasel"}],"Groups":[{"name":"Austin SQL Saturday","slug":"austin-sql-saturday"},{"name":"Capitol Area Central Texas Users of SQL Server","slug":"capitol-area-central-texas-users-of-sql-server"}],"Tags":[{"name":"Spark","slug":"spark"}]},{"Title":"Using calculation groups in DAX","Url":"https://usergroup.tv/videos/using-calculation-groups-in-dax/","Thumbnail":"https://i.vimeocdn.com/video/854620219_295x166.jpg","Excerpt":"<p>Calculation groups are the most important feature introduced in DAX after variables in 2015.

Sometimes it starts to become a double-edged sword of sorts. They realize that the power of autonomy comes with a great responsibility for the development teams and the organization in general. The need for a technical ear that hears as many designs as possible arises. Traditionally, that leads to architectural oversight. Then they gather a bunch of senior engineers and call them architects. Things start to get worse because nobody can really figure out what the right level of oversight is. The group gets viewed as an “Ivory tower” that’s always busy in meetings when needed. Now, they have moved smart engineers from coding to meetings, anarchy is breeding and nobody is happy. What’s going on here? What can we do? In this talk, we’ll take a look at how to break some traditional molds and modernize the architect’s role. I’ll take you through a journey to explore some principles, forged through practice from real-world projects. You’ll learn strategies for mentoring development teams, scaling processes, and maximizing efficiency. With the right structures in place, architects can guide teams into the “pit of success,” as Scott Guthrie likes to put it. Together, we’ll strike down the walls of the ivory tower and raise up a new group of evolutionary architects.

This session is packed with practical examples and demos of where the latest high-performance APIs and language features can be applied in your applications. During this session, we'll apply types such as Span and Memory to efficiently process data and to parse strings. We'll examine System.IO.Pipelines, offering high-performance I/O and we'll utilise ArrayPool to help reduce GC allocations. Since .NET Core 3.0, we have new high-performance JSON APIs which we'll also add to our arsenal. Microsoft has made fantastic performance gains to the .NET Core framework; now it's time to apply them to your code! We'll begin by discussing when and why performance matters in your applications. You'll learn how to measure your code, and use a data-driven approach to focus your optimisations. These features can seem complicated, unapproachable and difficult to apply. In this session, Steve introduces high-performance newcomers to the features, showing you how they work, where they can be applied and how to measure performance improvements in your code. This talk is for developers, who like Steve, are ready to begin their journey towards writing faster .NET code, which allocates less. This talk is aimed at all levels of .NET Core developers. It's intended to provide real-world experience of applying high-performance techniques to .NET code. It shares the journey and experience of a relative performance novice, learning about these features for the first time to solve real problems and optimise code.

We need to know that the system will behave correctly when messages arrive out of order. It needs the ability to retry on delivery failure without causing duplication. And we must be sure that all nodes converge even if they don't all subscribe to the same queues. We need ACID 2.0. A system that is ACID 2.0 is: Associative, Commutative, Idempotent, and Distributed.

You load balance your web farm only to find out that your database is a bottleneck. Or to find out you need to synchronize caches across your farm. Akka.NET and its implementation of the actor model make scaling a bit easier. Developing a highly concurrent stateful system becomes a breeze.

Which definition do you prefer? The date or scope commitments (maybe even both!) were met, without too many (or too large of) issues, and so sufficiency is declared. Done is declared. The work increment met its success criteria, it \"ships\", and customers are happy. You're done! On non-Agile projects, we've experienced things like \"defect triage\" to debate bug severity, particularly showstoppers, or de-scoping of \"required\" requirements because of an impending deadline. The product is only demonstrated to customers or senior managers near the end of the project, with often unhappy and even disastrous results. Agile approaches should provide considerable flexibility to deliver value incrementally over the course of the project, but how does a team know the features are done? How does a team and the organization know that the incremental value is ready for the customers to see and use? Teams need to know what \"done\" means at the individual story level, the theme level, and the release level, so they can always work toward being done at every level. In this presentation, we will discuss: How to define acceptance criteria for each story, The team working agreement (commonly called a Definition of Done) for technical excellence, with examples, Guidelines for Story, Feature, and Release Done criteria, \"Done\" traps to recognize and avoid.

Many development teams have adopted Agile frameworks to improve their ability to deliver software. This has led to a local optimization for the development teams and they have become good at delivering potentially shippable increments of their products, but from there, they typically see organizational constraints in moving it to the customer. The development organization is quickly adding features to the queue waiting to be released, but the operations teams are struggling to put out fires in production, maintain stability, and provide the environments and infrastructure needed so development teams can move their new functionality forward. The operation team’s focus on stability usually minimizes the number of changes in production thus creating infrequent, large batches being deployed at a planned date. Forrester has called this model of working \"Water-Scrum-Fall\", where development teams are using Scrum to deliver the next set of features, but integration, testing, and Operations are still doing big batch waterfall practices before releasing. Can Agile and DevOps bring the development and operations teams together to remove the organizational constraints in moving the software to the customer? In this session, we’ll talk about the relationship between Agile and DevOps, not as an intersection, but as a progression of capability with development and operation teams working together to remove those constraints. We’ll discuss how using Agile and DevOps practices, teams can release value faster, with higher quality, and in more stable environments.\r\n</p>","PostDate":"2018-05-24T16:40:48","Id":441,"Mp4Video":"http://player.vimeo.com/external/271954977.hd.mp4?s=382c854b0c636c4171fd9a25648c656c9b6e19bc&profile_id=175&oauth2_token_id=20985841","Mp4VideoLow":"http://player.vimeo.com/external/271954977.sd.mp4?s=95654372700f40e7a7f386a89017794201ca0dce&profile_id=165&oauth2_token_id=20985841","OgvVideo":"","Speakers":[{"name":"Leland Newsom","slug":"leland-newsom"}],"Groups":[{"name":"Austin Agile","slug":"austin-agile"}],"Tags":[{"name":"Agile","slug":"agile"}]},{"Title":"Keep Austin Agile 2018 Keynote Intro","Url":"https://usergroup.tv/videos/keep-austin-agile-2018-keynote-intro/","Thumbnail":"https://i.vimeocdn.com/video/703256954_295x166.jpg","Excerpt":"<p>Welcome to Keep Austin Agile 2018, an exciting conference packed with 35 sessions crafted by speakers from the Austin agile community and around the country.

What if Reese said that in 45 minutes she could teach you how to plan that six-month project in 10% of the time it would have taken you to plan the old way? During this learning-packed workshop, you will learn how to plan the Agile way. Using a real project, you will build a backlog, estimate that backlog, prioritize it, order it based on ROI, capacity plan, and track to completion. The goal is to not deliver a plan. The goal is to deliver value.

In this talk, we'll first give a quick overview of common backlog confessions, then we will focus on the technical user story confession. In Agile, we want all of our requirements to be about the user (As a <some kind of user>, I want <some functionality>, so that I can <achieve some benefit>.) as they should be because it forces the teams to think about the use and value of every single thing they are building. But what happens if your product doesn't have direct users, like an API or middleware layer? How does the team and the Product Owner stay true to Agile principles in the backlog (and it's not by making our systems sentient!)? During this interactive session, we will discuss what a technical user story is, how it differs from the generic user story, and when it should be used. Then we'll have a few hands-on exercises using a simulated technical project and visual models to identify when the technical user story format is preferable and how to write one.\r\n</p>","PostDate":"2018-05-24T16:55:02","Id":452,"Mp4Video":"http://player.vimeo.com/external/271935844.hd.mp4?s=c7f4ca849d1b75d57bcbf8dce32e1396a44c1a1e&profile_id=175&oauth2_token_id=20985841","Mp4VideoLow":"http://player.vimeo.com/external/271935844.sd.mp4?s=1f67fcaa346d3e3f1f3923dbd498a3eac92aa375&profile_id=165&oauth2_token_id=20985841","OgvVideo":"","Speakers":[{"name":"Candase Hokanson","slug":"candase-hokanson"}],"Groups":[{"name":"Austin Agile","slug":"austin-agile"}],"Tags":[{"name":"Agile","slug":"agile"}]},{"Title":"Certainty in a Risky World","Url":"https://usergroup.tv/videos/certainty-in-a-risky-world/","Thumbnail":"https://i.vimeocdn.com/video/703383565_295x166.jpg","Excerpt":"<p>Have you ever noticed that releases of software at your organization directly correlate to problems and issues that arise as new code begins powering your site or application?

In this presentation, we'll cover some useful metrics for releases for both large and small development efforts. These metrics include number of defects, unit test coverage, and passing test cases. We'll also demonstrate how these can be pulled together into a single dashboard, as well as one single rating, in order to best communicate whether or not a release or large program effort is ready.

But they can't be trusted. Build a solution in Git that keeps things fair without trust. The solution: blockchain! In Git, it's a shared repository; in blockchain, a distributed ledger. Where Git has commits, blockchain has blocks. Git uses SHA, and so does blockchain. Discover how blockchain technology actually works by building a blockchain using Git. Along the way, you'll discover features such as: Wallets, Proof of work, Mining, 51% attack. By the end of this demonstration, you will know how blockchain solves the zero-trust problem. You will clearly see its limitations. And you will discover what you are sacrificing for that solution. Learn several patterns that you could use to solve the problems you really have. But the problems that blockchain solves best, you don't have. That's why you don't need a blockchain. But if you really do, here's how they work.</p>","PostDate":"2018-10-13T14:08:41","Id":460,"Mp4Video":"http://player.vimeo.com/external/295054638.hd.mp4?s=a4d49fe80659b376c602459408b6c9f9c231ff4f&profile_id=175&oauth2_token_id=20985841","Mp4VideoLow":"http://player.vimeo.com/external/295054638.sd.mp4?s=af9d59f1b81e31dd7325c5931107f63a9320fd45&profile_id=165&oauth2_token_id=20985841","OgvVideo":"","Speakers":[{"name":"Michael L Perry","slug":"michael-l-perry"}],"Groups":[{"name":"Dallas Dev Fest Weekend","slug":"dallas-dev-fest-weekend"}],"Tags":[{"name":"Blockchain","slug":"blockchain"}]},{"Title":"Mixing Realities - The New Frontier Of User Experiences","Url":"https://usergroup.tv/videos/mixing-realities-the-new-frontier-of-user-experiences/","Thumbnail":"https://i.vimeocdn.com/video/732109448_295x166.jpg","Excerpt":"<p>During this talk, I will share with attendees my view of today's mixed reality market and technology and where I believe they will be in 5 years.

It's a simple concept that grows into a complex process when a software company begins to expand its development team. If you're not careful along the way, you'll begin to lose productivity along with your competitive edge. This presentation will detail a powerful tool that can help with the transformation process: The Dev Procedure. This tool has enabled us at APS Payroll to deliver high-quality solutions to our customers with minimal developer resources. During this presentation, you will learn how describing a solution before any coding begins will empower your development teams to write high-quality code and develop their skills at the same time. Experienced devs are able to express their ideas and propose solutions that might not otherwise come up. Junior devs are able to touch any part of the codebase since they have a guide for the solution they are implementing. Plus, junior devs can see into how the experienced devs think about certain problems, and can learn more about how to build great software. This talk will provide insight into our pipeline model of software development and how Dev Procedures enable our small team to compete against Fortune 500 companies. By adopting this into your own workflow, you can super-charge it just as we have. Arm your development team with the right tools.

Unlike reflection-based IoC frameworks, Micronaut provides advanced dependency injection and AOP support at compilation time. As a result, your application startup time and memory usage are reduced to a minimum, regardless of the the size of your codebase. Micronaut's HTTP layer is built on Netty, a proven asynchronous network toolkit designed around an event loop and efficient, non-blocking I/O. Native support for Reactive Streams allows you to build out your API using expressive libraries such as RxJava, and apply reactive programming patterns across your entire application. In an era of microservices and cloud computing, Micronaut incorporates support for cloud-friendly reliability patterns - from load balancing and circuit breakers to shared configuration and service discovery - and makes these features available and easily configurable from within your application. From the ground up, Micronaut applications are \"natively\" cloud-native. In this talk, Jeff Brown - one of the founders of the Grails full-stack MVC framework and the Micronaut framework - introduces Micronaut and demonstrates features related to building robust microservices - with minimal code and maximum simplicity - using Micronaut.\r\n</p>","PostDate":"2018-11-15T16:56:12","Id":476,"Mp4Video":"http://player.vimeo.com/external/301305184.hd.mp4?s=da646d6908a4501cde87b43d4a3fc4f837dcd548&profile_id=175&oauth2_token_id=20985841","Mp4VideoLow":"http://player.vimeo.com/external/301305184.sd.mp4?s=5e1087ddd57e226e8cb334ca289c26d2ead38a66&profile_id=165&oauth2_token_id=20985841","OgvVideo":"","Speakers":[{"name":"Jeff Brown","slug":"jeff-brown"}],"Groups":[{"name":"Austin Cloud Native Meetup","slug":"austin-cloud-native-meetup"}],"Tags":[{"name":"Micronaut","slug":"micronaut"}]},{"Title":"FAKE 5","Url":"https://usergroup.tv/videos/fake-5/","Thumbnail":"https://i.vimeocdn.com/video/739822130_295x166.jpg","Excerpt":"<p>This month is FAKE 5 and some nice new features that make it more than just a build tool.</p>","PostDate":"2018-11-15T16:57:43","Id":477,"Mp4Video":"http://player.vimeo.com/external/301295483.hd.mp4?s=61ec962e904020fb17f85ac8aae22076ffa4882a&profile_id=175&oauth2_token_id=20985841","Mp4VideoLow":"http://player.vimeo.com/external/301295483.sd.mp4?s=91f4c8434c62b989610c37b2ba7f38e3c517fbf6&profile_id=165&oauth2_token_id=20985841","OgvVideo":"","Speakers":[{"name":"Chet Husk","slug":"chet-husk"}],"Groups":[{"name":"Austin F# Meetup","slug":"austin-f-meetup"}],"Tags":[{"name":"F#","slug":"f"}]},{"Title":"Monitoring options for Azure","Url":"https://usergroup.tv/videos/monitoring-options-for-azure/","Thumbnail":"https://i.vimeocdn.com/video/745979214_295x166.jpg","Excerpt":"<p>Learn what options exist for monitoring workloads in Azure using Azure native tools.

NuGet goes beyond simply adding references to your project and allows for fully automated configuration and setup of third-party libraries directly from within Visual Studio using either the GUI or Powershell. NuGet allows you to not only search through an ever-expanding catalog of application packages but also to discover new ones that can help you and your team be more productive. In this session, we'll start by discussing package management from a high level, move on to installing, configuring and using NuGet from within the IDE and finally we'll discuss how you can build your very own NuGet packages and distribute them either through the officialNuGet stream or your own private repository.

This simplifies your view model code by eliminating property changed notification, message publication, and state management. Stateless view models enable a powerful new set of patterns. In this session, we will explore some of those patterns, including: Linq projections, Selection model, Dynamic search and sort.

Learning Objectives: · Learn the key elements of the Scrum Framework and how it drives success in building software · Discover Scrum’s limitations in large organizations and how they can be over overcome · Explore 3 non-exclusive and interworking organizational patterns that your teams can adopt to gain the benefits of scrum while scaling to larger development and product groups.</p>","PostDate":"2013-04-03T17:41:28","Id":592,"Mp4Video":"http://player.vimeo.com/external/102966605.hd.mp4?s=93875f447adf29f70f81fe8cc2459b57a8492720&profile_id=113&oauth2_token_id=20985841","Mp4VideoLow":"http://player.vimeo.com/external/102966605.sd.mp4?s=c58e9e36ce3836e453366ce5b1cb765bda959376&profile_id=112&oauth2_token_id=20985841","OgvVideo":"","Speakers":[{"name":"Caleb Jenkins","slug":"caleb-jenkins"}],"Groups":[{"name":"North Dallas .NET UG","slug":"north-dallas-net-ug"}],"Tags":[{"name":"Scrum","slug":"scrum"},{"name":"Agile","slug":"agile"}]},{"Title":"Online and Offline Mobile Applications with Correspondence ","Url":"https://usergroup.tv/videos/online-and-offline-mobile-applications-with-correspondence/","Thumbnail":"https://i.vimeocdn.com/video/485085354_295x166.jpg","Excerpt":"<p>Phones are personal devices, so users expect their data to be local. But they are also collaborative devices, so users expect them to talk to each other. An occasionally connected Windows Phone application is the best of both worlds. It stores personal data locally for instant access. And it synchronizes with remote services for collaboration.\r\n</p>\r\n<p>Correspondence is an open source library specifically designed to make it easy to build occasionally connected applications. When you design your data model using its DSL, it generates both a local database and a network protocol. Then it gives you an object model to code against that seamlessly bridges the two worlds.\r\n</p>\r\n<p>Not only will I demonstrate a collaborative Windows Phone application, but I’ll teach you how to write one. You start with the data model, written in a Domain Specific Language called Factual. Then you expose that model through a View Model layer. Data bind your View Model to the UI, and your application is complete.\r\n</p>\r\n<p>When the user makes a change, it is both stored to the local database and published to the server. Changes made by other users are automatically pushed to the phone. Through the magic of data binding, the user is instantly notified of the change.\r\n</p>","PostDate":"2013-04-27T13:10:15","Id":593,"Mp4Video":"http://player.vimeo.com/external/102966491.hd.mp4?s=81522f4a88c2377c7af1ada7aed88e1781e69625&profile_id=113&oauth2_token_id=20985841","Mp4VideoLow":"http://player.vimeo.com/external/102966491.sd.mp4?s=09a74d616ebd910d376e9421d731c69c45e92b54&profile_id=112&oauth2_token_id=20985841","OgvVideo":"","Speakers":[{"name":"Michael L Perry","slug":"michael-l-perry"}],"Groups":[{"name":"Code PaLOUsa","slug":"code-palousa"}],"Tags":[{"name":"Correspondence","slug":"correspondence"}]},{"Title":"Design Time Data ","Url":"https://usergroup.tv/videos/design-time-data/","Thumbnail":"https://i.vimeocdn.com/video/484300667_295x166.jpg","Excerpt":"<p>\r\nLorem ipsum dolor sint.\r\n</p><p>\r\nYou're building the next great app. You've gotten down to the last few tweaks.

The beautiful thing is that the RAII pattern protects not only against memory leaks, but also against resource leaks as well! In fact most languages are adopting features designed to mimic RAII to help combat their resource leaks. We will begin with an overview of RAII and its use throughout the C++ libraries.

Microsoft's Azure cloud computing platform has made it incredibly simple for developers across a variety of platforms to build massively scalable, resilient solutions with minimal investment. In this session, Casey focuses specifically on Azure's storage capabilities including storing large, unstructured blobs of data, working with databases, relational or otherwise, and using Azure's powerful queueing mechanism. We will begin with a brief overview of the Azure platform, including general architecture and development environment setup. Next, we will take a deep dive into Azure's storage capabilities and, finally, we will wrap up the session by creating a few simple applications that demonstrate how to leverage these capabilities. Join us and learn how you can take advantage of the cloud in order to simplify the way that you build scalable applications.\r\n</p>","PostDate":"2012-10-03T15:21:14","Id":626,"Mp4Video":"http://player.vimeo.com/external/104229808.hd.mp4?s=8793b6ab859a70c81fc1b49cff9dad2bdf2fb560&profile_id=113&oauth2_token_id=20985841","Mp4VideoLow":"http://player.vimeo.com/external/104229808.sd.mp4?s=6c142114af868cd930b82369aa47f5a861020be9&profile_id=112&oauth2_token_id=20985841","OgvVideo":"","Speakers":[{"name":"Casey Watson","slug":"casey-watson"}],"Groups":[{"name":"North Dallas .NET UG","slug":"north-dallas-net-ug"}],"Tags":[{"name":"Azure","slug":"azure"},{"name":"Storage","slug":"storage"}]},{"Title":"Collaborative Windows Phone Apps with Correspondence","Url":"https://usergroup.tv/videos/collaborative-windows-phone-apps-with-correspondence/","Thumbnail":"https://i.vimeocdn.com/video/486706625_295x166.jpg","Excerpt":"<p>Phones are personal devices, so users expect their data to be local.

Augmented Reality is enabling software developers to build engaging immersive apps that connect users with their physical surroundings in new and exciting ways by integrating a variety of data into the physical world through the magic of their mobile phone. At it's core Augmented Reality requires beyond PhD level computer science genius in a variety of areas including computer vision, 3D modeling, and artificial intelligence. Lucky for us, those geniuses have produced lots of toolkits, frameworks and apps that allow us mere mortals to more easily integrate Augmented Reality into our apps.

NuGet goes beyond simply adding references to your project and allows for fully automated configuration and setup of third-party libraries directly from within Visual Studio using either the GUI or Powershell. NuGet allows you to not only search through an ever-expanding catalog of application packages but also to discover new ones that can help you and your team be more productive. In this session, we&rsquo;ll start by discussing package management from a high level, move on to installing, configuring and using NuGet form within the IDE and finally we&rsquo;ll discuss how you can build your very own NuGet packages and distribute them either through the official NuGet stream or your own private repository.

In order to provide integrated solutions that add business value, applications must be connected. Modern approaches for enterprise application integration (EAI) such as Service Oriented Architecture (SOA) separate applications into services that can be accessed via a standard interface such as a web service. This collection of services provides a platform on which new applications can be created that leverage the existing functionality.</p>\r\n<p>However, as application complexity increases, the coupling of services becomes an impediment in adapting applications to meet the ever-changing goals of the business. Event Driven Architecture (EDA) is a method of designing and implementing systems where events are exchanged between highly decoupled components and services. EDA does not replace SOA, instead it compliments the request/response nature of SOA with a highly scalable event model for building and coordinating asynchronous transactions.</p>\r\n<p>In this presentation, I will explain event driven architecture, describe the different types of events, demonstrate how events can be related and orchestrated, and provide a basic understanding of how this method can drive the architecture of enterprise systems. In addition to understanding the concepts of event driven architecture, we will explore a working sample built using an open-source .NET messaging framework called MassTransit.?</p>","PostDate":"2011-05-27T01:13:49","Id":679,"Mp4Video":"http://player.vimeo.com/external/113704521.hd.mp4?s=0670d44cb0757e5781f63d0fc908e37d62650c42&profile_id=113&oauth2_token_id=20985841","Mp4VideoLow":"http://player.vimeo.com/external/113704521.sd.mp4?s=e2d79503065705913f74f19f5a60ded0713e3405&profile_id=112&oauth2_token_id=20985841","OgvVideo":"","Speakers":[{"name":"Chris Patterson","slug":"chris-patterson"}],"Groups":[{"name":"Oklahoma Groups","slug":"oklahoma"},{"name":"Tulsa School of Dev","slug":"tulsa-school-of-dev"}],"Tags":[{"name":"EDA","slug":"eda"}]},{"Title":"Practical Test Driven Development ","Url":"https://usergroup.tv/videos/practical-test-driven-development/","Thumbnail":"https://i.vimeocdn.com/video/500553151_295x166.jpg","Excerpt":"<p>&nbsp;</p>","PostDate":"2011-03-10T19:20:44","Id":680,"Mp4Video":"http://player.vimeo.com/external/114764795.hd.mp4?s=10d961d16b5c6324fa9621a3a359879e254f9ad7&profile_id=113&oauth2_token_id=20985841","Mp4VideoLow":"http://player.vimeo.com/external/114764795.sd.mp4?s=3ac54cbba61546f62dfb2587b54cdf60aa33f377&profile_id=112&oauth2_token_id=20985841","OgvVideo":"","Speakers":[{"name":"Tim Rayburn","slug":"tim-rayburn"}],"Groups":[{"name":"Dallas .NET UG","slug":"dallas-net-ug"}],"Tags":[{"name":"TDD","slug":"tdd"}]},{"Title":"Sams Teach Yourself C# in 24 Hours - Hour 8: Using Strings and Regular Expressions","Url":"https://usergroup.tv/videos/sams-teach-yourself-c-in-24-hours-hour-8-using-strings-and-regular-expressions/","Thumbnail":"https://i.vimeocdn.com/video/500554314_295x166.jpg","Excerpt":"<p>In this talk we will be covering Hour 8, Strings and Regular Expressions, of C# in 24 Hours by Scott Dorman</p>","PostDate":"2011-03-12T13:42:25","Id":681,"Mp4Video":"http://player.vimeo.com/external/114765632.hd.mp4?s=02f498c6bb5764ba2db5b591266f6d3a9b5495f7&profile_id=119&oauth2_token_id=20985841","Mp4VideoLow":"http://player.vimeo.com/external/114765632.sd.mp4?s=4c2486e72e51be27a857b944d4d98083e71a67b3&profile_id=112&oauth2_token_id=20985841","OgvVideo":"","Speakers":[{"name":"Shawn Weisfeld","slug":"shawn-weisfeld"}],"Groups":[{"name":"North Texas PC UG","slug":"north-texas-pc-ug"}],"Tags":[{"name":"c# in 24 hrs","slug":"c-in-24-hrs"}]},{"Title":"Introduction to WCF RIA Services: Part 2 ","Url":"https://usergroup.tv/videos/introduction-to-ria-services/","Thumbnail":"https://i.vimeocdn.com/video/500554515_295x166.jpg","Excerpt":"<p>&nbsp;</p>","PostDate":"2011-03-12T19:52:14","Id":682,"Mp4Video":"http://player.vimeo.com/external/114765807.hd.mp4?s=130bd2d9c97e5d7e30c0af59ca3ea25a9f06c1d1&profile_id=119&oauth2_token_id=20985841","Mp4VideoLow":"http://player.vimeo.com/external/114765807.sd.mp4?s=191bfb73b493cbf2f7e9d32f6f2a1163c7cf2480&profile_id=112&oauth2_token_id=20985841","OgvVideo":"","Speakers":[{"name":"Robert Burger","slug":"robert-burger"}],"Groups":[{"name":"North Texas PC UG","slug":"north-texas-pc-ug"}],"Tags":[{"name":"RIA Services","slug":"ria-services"}]},{"Title":"Ram on SharePoint March 2011","Url":"https://usergroup.tv/videos/ram-talks-about-sharepoint/","Thumbnail":"https://i.vimeocdn.com/video/500554601_295x166.jpg","Excerpt":"<p>&nbsp;</p>","PostDate":"2011-03-12T19:58:20","Id":683,"Mp4Video":"http://player.vimeo.com/external/114765909.hd.mp4?s=3d9188bad350439029be1f429e4b4aa7868f1576&profile_id=119&oauth2_token_id=20985841","Mp4VideoLow":"http://player.vimeo.com/external/114765909.sd.mp4?s=65753e214cca7590a33f8b18b70be46f2c6578f7&profile_id=112&oauth2_token_id=20985841","OgvVideo":"","Speakers":[{"name":"Ram Yadav","slug":"ram-yadav"}],"Groups":[{"name":"North Texas PC UG","slug":"north-texas-pc-ug"}],"Tags":[{"name":"Sharepoint","slug":"sharepoint"}]},{"Title":"Confessions of a MEF Addict","Url":"https://usergroup.tv/videos/confessions-of-a-mef-addict/","Thumbnail":"https://i.vimeocdn.com/video/500555308_295x166.jpg","Excerpt":"<p>You might have heard about the ability for you to build amazing add-ins for Microsoft Visual Studio 2010.

Arm yourself with the latest tools in .NET 4.5 -- the async and await keywords -- to take full advantage of the platform.</p>","PostDate":"2012-02-23T21:29:27","Id":739,"Mp4Video":"http://player.vimeo.com/external/108064118.hd.mp4?s=24defb88e33013cd3d4e8183340e31ccd90a32a7&profile_id=113&oauth2_token_id=20985841","Mp4VideoLow":"http://player.vimeo.com/external/108064118.sd.mp4?s=0b46eab275b50378caf07143a1caa456bbd7a880&profile_id=112&oauth2_token_id=20985841","OgvVideo":"","Speakers":[{"name":"Michael L Perry","slug":"michael-l-perry"}],"Groups":[{"name":"VNext Dallas","slug":"vnext-dallas"}],"Tags":[{"name":"async","slug":"async"},{"name":"win8","slug":"win8"}]},{"Title":"Kinect Dallas Keynote","Url":"https://usergroup.tv/videos/kinect-dallas-keynote/","Thumbnail":"https://i.vimeocdn.com/video/492994856_295x166.jpg","Excerpt":"","PostDate":"2012-01-28T15:36:29","Id":740,"Mp4Video":"http://player.vimeo.com/external/109122090.hd.mp4?s=7623c73f590fe7f45559fc7293ff13d55bb79e51&profile_id=119&oauth2_token_id=20985841","Mp4VideoLow":"http://player.vimeo.com/external/109122090.sd.mp4?s=8965f33ef7eb87eb1d3837dd5c308b17d79005ba&profile_id=112&oauth2_token_id=20985841","OgvVideo":"","Speakers":[{"name":"Tim Huckaby","slug":"tim-huckaby"},{"name":"Eric Leaseburg","slug":"eric-leaseburg"}],"Groups":[],"Tags":[{"name":"Kinect","slug":"kinect"}]},{"Title":"The Winding Road","Url":"https://usergroup.tv/videos/the-winding-road/","Thumbnail":"https://i.vimeocdn.com/video/495922142_295x166.jpg","Excerpt":"<p>Keynote from the 2011 Oklahoma City SQL Saturday</p>","PostDate":"2011-08-27T20:40:19","Id":741,"Mp4Video":"http://player.vimeo.com/external/111340961.hd.mp4?s=512ca713f8d327ee1efdf9a0cdd5589b23206566&profile_id=113&oauth2_token_id=20985841","Mp4VideoLow":"http://player.vimeo.com/external/111340961.sd.mp4?s=6f1cbe836166fe3290232fb0973c47624c1c614e&profile_id=112&oauth2_token_id=20985841","OgvVideo":"","Speakers":[{"name":"Steve Jones","slug":"steve-jones"}],"Groups":[{"name":"Oklahoma Groups","slug":"oklahoma"},{"name":"SQL Saturday","slug":"sql-saturday"}],"Tags":[{"name":"Keynote","slug":"keynote"}]},{"Title":"The Best of SharePoint Conference 2011 - Coskun Cavusoglu","Url":"https://usergroup.tv/videos/the-best-of-sharepoint-conference-2011-coskun-cavusoglu/","Thumbnail":"https://i.vimeocdn.com/video/494180096_295x166.jpg","Excerpt":"<p>The Best of SharePoint Conference 2011 - In this talk Coskun Cavusoglu will tell us what he thought was so interesting about:</p>\r\n<ul>\r\n<li>Reporting Services, Project Crescent and Data Visualization</li>\r\n<li>Asynchronous Programming with vNext of Visual Studio</li>\r\n<li>SharePoint Internet Sites that Integrate FAST Search</li>\r\n<li>And more...</li>\r\n</ul>","PostDate":"2011-11-03T14:06:42","Id":742,"Mp4Video":"http://player.vimeo.com/external/110065177.hd.mp4?s=51989cfe7eea506f24f7d8df739f3b28a9bacec7&profile_id=119&oauth2_token_id=20985841","Mp4VideoLow":"http://player.vimeo.com/external/110065177.sd.mp4?s=976d7a4447470792192c30ed41f70028c23c20be&profile_id=112&oauth2_token_id=20985841","OgvVideo":"","Speakers":[{"name":"Coskun Cavusoglu","slug":"coskun-cavusoglu"}],"Groups":[{"name":"Chicago SharePoint UG","slug":"chicago-sharepoint-ug"}],"Tags":[{"name":"Sharepoint","slug":"sharepoint"}]},{"Title":"Security for Silverlight and Click-Once Applications","Url":"https://usergroup.tv/videos/security-for-silverlight-and-click-once-applications/","Thumbnail":"https://i.vimeocdn.com/video/494185351_295x166.jpg","Excerpt":"<p>Here are some of the wide range of security related topics that we'll be covering.</p>\r\n<ul>\r\n<li>Basic Terminology</li>\r\n<li>WPF Click-Once Basics and Security Techniques</li>\r\n<li>XBAP Applications</li>\r\n<li>Silverlight Security Techniques</li>\r\n<li>WCF Service Usage</li>\r\n<li>ASP.NET Authentication Service</li>\r\n<li>And Lots of web.config configuration</li>\r\n</ul>","PostDate":"2011-11-01T14:14:49","Id":743,"Mp4Video":"http://player.vimeo.com/external/110069545.hd.mp4?s=1fc0d52069294805d97bd026b58ee2e0671c9155&profile_id=119&oauth2_token_id=20985841","Mp4VideoLow":"http://player.vimeo.com/external/110069545.sd.mp4?s=a36b0e96ff93688e8e56cc68ffe9e74a9f2e7d81&profile_id=112&oauth2_token_id=20985841","OgvVideo":"","Speakers":[{"name":"Vince Blasberg","slug":"vince-blasberg"}],"Groups":[{"name":"Dallas XAML UG","slug":"dallas-xaml-ug"}],"Tags":[{"name":"Silverlight","slug":"silverlight"},{"name":"Security","slug":"security"}]},{"Title":"Governing Your Database Environment","Url":"https://usergroup.tv/videos/governing-your-database-environment/","Thumbnail":"https://i.vimeocdn.com/video/495924241_295x166.jpg","Excerpt":"<p>As we all know about SQL sprawl, it becomes cumbersome for the DBAs tostay on top of all the servers in the environment.

Desktops, servers, smart phones, tablets, and even some lesser-known embedded devices are built with multiple cores. After giving up on advancing with one core for processor speed due to heat issues, hardware manufacturers have focused on building multi-core CPUs and putting two, four, eight, or even more cores on a processor.</p>\r\n<p>Obviously, utilizing these cores in the best form is a vital task to take the most out of the available hardware and this has driven the research and investments in computer architecture, programming language, and compiler design communities to facilitate the process of programming for multiple cores. However, there are some fundamental issues involved with this task that make it difficult. Computer architects have been able to solve the problems with hardware, however, the problems on the software side are difficult enough that this field is now one of the primary areas of research and investment both at academia and industry. Recent versions of programming languages and compilers have added many new features to enable concurrency and simplify that, and .NET Framework 4.0 was not an exception.</p>\r\n<p>These trends in the software world will eventually drive the programming community to a point where programmers need to deal with concurrency more seriously in action. Therefore, the professional programmer of future will need great skills and deep understanding of parallel programming to succeed.</p>\r\n<p>In this session we discover different aspects of parallel programming. This session consists of two main parts: in the first part, we introduce the concepts and principles of parallel programming and the main challenges involved in writing concurrent code, and in the second part, we apply these concepts in action using the .NET Framework to see what features are provided to facilitate parallel programming. This will also cover the new features added in .NET Framework 4.0 that enhance parallel programming for .NET developers significantly.</p>","PostDate":"2011-09-07T03:22:55","Id":747,"Mp4Video":"http://player.vimeo.com/external/111926233.hd.mp4?s=011650b068ae3d37b339d195db5ccb4c45d6d301&profile_id=113&oauth2_token_id=20985841","Mp4VideoLow":"http://player.vimeo.com/external/111926233.sd.mp4?s=0e5deda20826c073ccc1cd887fcb51e78fa0f884&profile_id=112&oauth2_token_id=20985841","OgvVideo":"","Speakers":[{"name":"Keyvan Nayyeri","slug":"keyvan-nayyeri"}],"Groups":[{"name":"North Dallas .NET UG","slug":"north-dallas-net-ug"}],"Tags":[{"name":"Parallel Programming","slug":"parallel-programming"}]},{"Title":"To REST or Not To REST?

Michael Kappel talks about HierarchyIDs including what they are, how to use them, when to use them, and also when not to. Microsoft has made implementing parent-child relationships faster and simpler to implement successfully through the new native support of hierarchical data in SQL Server 2008. The HierarchyID is a common language runtime (CLR) data type and because of this Microsoft was able to build in a number of methods to make traversing nodes simple. Initial setup and configuration of the HierarchyID data type can seem tricky and confusing at first. Especially with real work situations like having multiple root nodes or both branch and root nodes simultaneously. In this demonstration I will setup and implement standard node branching as well as Multi-root and tree branch/root combinations for advanced hierarchical data scenarios. HierarchyID is a powerful solution to Parent, Child, Ancestor, Descendent, and Sibling data management. The true genius of the HierarchyID data type is simple and flexible design that is shockingly fast in node related quires.</p>","PostDate":"2011-11-02T02:07:51","Id":757,"Mp4Video":"http://player.vimeo.com/external/119594227.hd.mp4?s=36a3b0b242a2f3c23a3074cba9058c87333c5801&profile_id=113&oauth2_token_id=20985841","Mp4VideoLow":"http://player.vimeo.com/external/119594227.sd.mp4?s=4ea92c0203dfe090e9f39bcc044cc329ede25f85&profile_id=112&oauth2_token_id=20985841","OgvVideo":"","Speakers":[{"name":"Michael Kappel","slug":"michael-kappel"}],"Groups":[{"name":"Chicago IT Architects Group","slug":"citag"}],"Tags":[{"name":"HierarchyID","slug":"hierarchyid"}]},{"Title":"Silverlight HTML Bridge with jQuery and ASP.NET MVC 3 ","Url":"https://usergroup.tv/videos/silverlight-html-bridge-with-jquery-and-asp-net-mvc-3/","Thumbnail":"https://i.vimeocdn.com/video/507718286_295x166.jpg","Excerpt":"<p>This meeting will focus on the Silverlight-HTML Bridge (JavaScript).

The platform has evolved steadily since the .NET Framework was released, but many of the technical decisions made early in ASP.NET’s life don't make sense in the context of modern web development. By cutting loose some of the baggage from earlier versions, the ASP.NET team has been able to make sweeping changes to bring the framework in line with its lightweight, agile contemporaries. In this presentation, Brian will show how the next version of ASP.NET will be leaner and more flexible than the platform has ever been.

It will now be possible to ask questions like \"show me what query plans have changed since yesterday\" and to quickly ask the optimizer to \"go back\" to the query plan that was working fine for you previously.</p>","PostDate":"2015-01-31T23:18:51","Id":821,"Mp4Video":"http://player.vimeo.com/external/118595641.hd.mp4?s=4016adb394c4545df902c21c7a0e1d905d3736d7&profile_id=119&oauth2_token_id=20985841","Mp4VideoLow":"http://player.vimeo.com/external/118595641.sd.mp4?s=543f7dd9f221be564c3c8fc3f12807c460d9ab28&profile_id=112&oauth2_token_id=20985841","OgvVideo":"","Speakers":[{"name":"Conor Cunningham","slug":"conor-cunningham"}],"Groups":[{"name":"Austin SQL Saturday","slug":"austin-sql-saturday"}],"Tags":[{"name":"SQL Tuning","slug":"sql-tuning"}]},{"Title":"15 Quick Tips for SSIS Performance","Url":"https://usergroup.tv/videos/15-quick-tips-for-ssis-performance/","Thumbnail":"https://i.vimeocdn.com/video/505504105_295x166.jpg","Excerpt":"<p>When reviewing your ETL processes, the No. 1 question is always, \"Does it work as expected?\" Closely following that question is the ubiquitous, \"How fast does it run?\" This session’s tips are targeted at improve the latter.

In this session were going to cover how execution plans get invalidated and why data skew could be the root cause to seeing different execution plans for the same query.  We will look at options for forcing a query to use a particular execution plan. Finally, you will learn how this complex problem can be identified and resolved simply using a new feature in SQL Server 2016 called Query Store.   Goals:  1. Learn how execution plans are created and removed from plan cache 2. Understand how and why execution plans change 3.

Docker has made software containers accessible to everyone. Today it is very easy to package an application or service into a container including all its dependencies and configurations. Since a container is immutable and (nearly) completely opaque to the outside world it can be deployed to any target host, be it the laptop of a developer, the build server, an integration server, staging or production. Gone are the days where we used to hear “runs on my machine”. DevOps has become much simpler because of containers, because of Docker.It’s a paradigm change and can be rightfully compared to the revolution shipping containers caused in logistics. In this lecture you will learn what a CI/CD pipeline used to look like and how Docker changed this picture. The presenter will also demonstrate how an ASP.NET core application can be packaged into a Docker container locally on the developer laptop and then once the code is pushed to GitHub, pulled, built, tested and pushed to to Docker hub by a CI server from where it can be deployed to any target environment.</p>","PostDate":"2016-04-11T09:11:04","Id":848,"Mp4Video":"http://player.vimeo.com/external/162498538.hd.mp4?s=a2289a4fb66953cab6f2ed6a5005e0d2e7b676c4&profile_id=119&oauth2_token_id=20985841","Mp4VideoLow":"http://player.vimeo.com/external/162498538.sd.mp4?s=8b30482450d9d1bbbea10ddefbe02b23664f72fa&profile_id=165&oauth2_token_id=20985841","OgvVideo":"","Speakers":[{"name":"Gabriel Schenker","slug":"gabriel-schenker"}],"Groups":[{"name":"Austin .NET UG","slug":"austin-net-ug"}],"Tags":[{"name":"Docker","slug":"docker"}]},{"Title":"Big Data & Analytics in Azure","Url":"https://usergroup.tv/videos/big-data-analytics-in-azure/","Thumbnail":"https://i.vimeocdn.com/video/566415745_295x166.jpg","Excerpt":"<p>Big Data & Analytics in Azure</p>","PostDate":"2016-04-16T10:56:28","Id":849,"Mp4Video":"http://player.vimeo.com/external/163218217.hd.mp4?s=bb65b58e1654ee2043c85d90986a4ad7a9bc7b3b&profile_id=174&oauth2_token_id=20985841","Mp4VideoLow":"http://player.vimeo.com/external/163218217.sd.mp4?s=e61b2084be91a1ad4da6710318559fe736dfc251&profile_id=165&oauth2_token_id=20985841","OgvVideo":"","Speakers":[{"name":"Ben Humphrey","slug":"ben-humphrey"}],"Groups":[{"name":"DFW Azure User Group","slug":"dfw-azure-user-group"}],"Tags":[{"name":"Azure","slug":"azure"}]},{"Title":"Introduction to Azure and cloud","Url":"https://usergroup.tv/videos/introduction-to-azure-and-cloud/","Thumbnail":"https://i.vimeocdn.com/video/566418431_295x166.jpg","Excerpt":"<p>Introduction to Azure and cloud</p>","PostDate":"2016-04-16T11:00:27","Id":850,"Mp4Video":"http://player.vimeo.com/external/163219238.hd.mp4?s=6ec680e4d34c05f34e6dbe01517e53d406a9017d&profile_id=174&oauth2_token_id=20985841","Mp4VideoLow":"http://player.vimeo.com/external/163219238.sd.mp4?s=f8b4c8e1c81f539ce7e5c7d71e34e39e2842dca5&profile_id=164&oauth2_token_id=20985841","OgvVideo":"","Speakers":[{"name":"Michael Washam","slug":"michael-washam"}],"Groups":[{"name":"DFW Azure User Group","slug":"dfw-azure-user-group"}],"Tags":[{"name":"Azure","slug":"azure"}]},{"Title":"Getting started with Azure Infrastructure as a Service (IaaS)","Url":"https://usergroup.tv/videos/getting-started-with-azure-infrastructure-as-a-service-iaas/","Thumbnail":"https://i.vimeocdn.com/video/566449374_295x166.jpg","Excerpt":"<p>Getting started with Azure Infrastructure as a Service (IaaS)</p>","PostDate":"2016-04-16T11:00:56","Id":851,"Mp4Video":"http://player.vimeo.com/external/163237838.hd.mp4?s=000a4eca01f3b741ef2abe06afacd7dc3d495a80&profile_id=174&oauth2_token_id=20985841","Mp4VideoLow":"http://player.vimeo.com/external/163237838.sd.mp4?s=9fa32d095f65c5ce5dcb17f9aec6e0c26476dd7a&profile_id=164&oauth2_token_id=20985841","OgvVideo":"","Speakers":[{"name":"Shad Phillips","slug":"shad-phillips"}],"Groups":[{"name":"DFW Azure User Group","slug":"dfw-azure-user-group"}],"Tags":[{"name":"Azure","slug":"azure"}]},{"Title":"Little Rock Tech Fest Keynote","Url":"https://usergroup.tv/videos/little-rock-tech-fest-keynote/","Thumbnail":"https://i.vimeocdn.com/video/540279596_295x166.jpg","Excerpt":"<p>In the opening keynote from the 2015 Little Rock Tech Fest.

Areas of interest range from Cloud-based back-ends to client-side technologies. Recently, Microsoft has introduced two major new initiatives of considerable importance to all Web Developers: ASP.NET vNext for development of HTML-based applications, and Microsoft Edge, as a replacement for the previous Internet Explorer browser. Both technologies are expected to have a major impact on the day-to-day lives of Web Developers. \r\n\r\n</p>\r\n<p>ASP.NET has long been a cornerstone for server-side components for all Microsoft-based web developers. In the latest incarnation, Microsoft has completely re-written ASP.NET in an effort to re-boot the platform for the next-generation Web. This has been done to support modern web development paradigms and requirements. The new version is more suitable for Cloud-operation, while still maintaining great support for on premise deployment. ASP.NET vNext supports cross platform operation, for those who prefer a Linux server platform. The new version also focusses on enhanced support for HTML5 technologies and things such as JavaScript, frameworks, build automation, and more. This part of the presentation is designed to give developers a good idea of the benefits of this exciting new version. \r\n\r\n\r\nEventbrite - Dallas ASP.Net Meeting - September 22, 2015 </p>","PostDate":"2015-09-22T14:18:40","Id":872,"Mp4Video":"http://player.vimeo.com/external/140491642.hd.mp4?s=a942ea895c93077b7d91889bada421f5dbffe13c&profile_id=119&oauth2_token_id=20985841","Mp4VideoLow":"http://player.vimeo.com/external/140491642.sd.mp4?s=82134ce017de46870b2a8760e41ca1fcbc3ad13e&profile_id=112&oauth2_token_id=20985841","OgvVideo":"","Speakers":[{"name":"Markus Egger","slug":"markus-egger"}],"Groups":[{"name":"Dallas ASP.NET UG","slug":"dallasaspnet"}],"Tags":[{"name":"ASP.NET vNext","slug":"asp-net-vnext"}]},{"Title":"Measure UP Austin 2015 Keynote","Url":"https://usergroup.tv/videos/measure-up-austin-2015-keynote/","Thumbnail":"https://i.vimeocdn.com/video/537234017_295x166.jpg","Excerpt":"","PostDate":"2015-09-26T11:54:16","Id":873,"Mp4Video":"http://player.vimeo.com/external/140641958.hd.mp4?s=9e269dda620210e8437619186b34670c8a5a2e40&profile_id=113&oauth2_token_id=20985841","Mp4VideoLow":"http://player.vimeo.com/external/140641958.sd.mp4?s=3e5f9151c376178815672bf74843fff20b9c1b2e&profile_id=112&oauth2_token_id=20985841","OgvVideo":"","Speakers":[{"name":"Jeffrey Palermo","slug":"jeffrey-palermo"}],"Groups":[{"name":"MeasureUp","slug":"measure-up"}],"Tags":[{"name":"Keynote","slug":"keynote"}]},{"Title":"Behold the Power of the PPO","Url":"https://usergroup.tv/videos/behold-the-power-of-the-ppo/","Thumbnail":"https://i.vimeocdn.com/video/537387571_295x166.jpg","Excerpt":"<p>Hint – this session is not about health coverage.

But most of the DDD literature focuses on the design and implementation patterns, which, while highly useful, are not the main point of contribution of DDD. DDD's primary contribution to the craft is the focus on the \"ubiquitous language\" of the domain - of truly understanding and modeling the domain, using the same terminology that is used by domain experts and business people. This forces the developers to learn and use the domain language when communicating with each other, with business people, and most importantly, when modeling the system and writing code. That is the strategic advantage of DDD, and is a topic often given too little attention in introduction-to-DDD materials.

But how do you synchronize data between phones and tablets? Learn how to data bind to the cloud. When a change is made on one device, the change appears on another. Data flows seamlessly across devices.But those devices aren't always connected. And even when they are, users don't want to wait for a network connection before they can see or work with their data. So data needs to be stored locally, and synchronized in the background.Build a universal app where the phone and tablet share a common data model. That model is synchronized through a cloud service and into local storage.

Allison Pollard and Cherie Silas At a critical moment in history the world pivoted because people began to look at things from a different perspective. They stopped asking themselves, “How do we get to the water?” and started asking themselves, “How do we get the water to us?” When we change our questions we get entirely different outcomes. Questions are powerful tools in the hands of agile teams that can help people discover innovative solutions that have been locked inside waiting to be released into our products! Join us for a high-energy workshop that teaches how questions can be used to help a team learn, grow, and break through thought barriers. Learn what makes certain questions provoke more thought than others and how to make your questions more impactful. Participants in this session will discover how to change the way they currently communicate to incorporate powerful questions that will unlock new thinking patterns in their teams. They will also interactively learn how to identify if the way questions are being asked are actually impacting others in the manner intended.</p>","PostDate":"2014-10-10T11:17:18","Id":990,"Mp4Video":"http://player.vimeo.com/external/108780364.hd.mp4?s=6435d3a19116e36a1bd33693eb2e653433e8c31e&profile_id=113&oauth2_token_id=20985841","Mp4VideoLow":"http://player.vimeo.com/external/108780364.sd.mp4?s=23ecf25dcd3cec4f89294a8448d36202b317f13b&profile_id=112&oauth2_token_id=20985841","OgvVideo":"","Speakers":[{"name":"Allison Pollard","slug":"allison-pollard"},{"name":"Cherie Silas","slug":"cherie-silas"}],"Groups":[{"name":"Dallas TechFest","slug":"dallas-techfest"}],"Tags":[{"name":"Questions","slug":"questions"}]},{"Title":"NoSQL: I doesn’t mean what you think it means","Url":"https://usergroup.tv/videos/nosql-i-doesnt-mean-what-you-think-it-means/","Thumbnail":"https://i.vimeocdn.com/video/492564994_295x166.jpg","Excerpt":"<p>Micro Services, horizontal scalability, and non-relational approaches are all encouraging adoption of NoSQL databases.

Understanding the power of appreciation languages and how the people react to the regular use (or lack of use) of these languages in the workplace can be a key component to creating a culture and environment filled with motivated individuals who feel valued and supported. This information can help leaders to resolve performance problems, build trust and transparency, increase collaboration and creativity, and improve retention rates. Using appreciation languages as a motivational tool and teaching others in the organization to speak these languages fluently leads to positive results because people who feel appreciated also feel valued, safe, creative, dedicated, motivated and able to accomplish anything. Therefore properly applying the languages of appreciation can be powerful skill that leaders can bring into their organizations in order to help high performing teams begin to emerge.</p>\r\n<p>*Five Appreciation Languages?: Words of Affirmation, ?Quality Time, ?Acts of Service?, Tangible Gifts, ?Physical Contact</p>\r\n<p>This presentation will describe the five appreciation languages and talk about effective ways to use them with individuals in the workplace as motivators using real life success stories as examples.

Internally, teams may compromise on the essential elements of Scrum, such as not holding a retrospective at the end of a sprint or holding stand-ups only when the entire team is present rather than on a daily basis. Collectively, these compromises are known as “ScrumButs” and are all too common and dilute the benefits that Scrum provides to software projects. These obstacles may also be applied externally, such as a requirement for a detailed project plan or “gate reviews” for the project to proceed to the next “phase.” Managing these obstacles to ensure that the benefits of Scrum are fully realized while understanding and managing the organizational culture are important to a successful adoption and maintaining continuous improvement.\r\n</p>","PostDate":"2014-08-22T17:30:44","Id":1006,"Mp4Video":"http://player.vimeo.com/external/104231528.hd.mp4?s=386ab8487c378003b10566cedbadb03b840a54b7&profile_id=113&oauth2_token_id=20985841","Mp4VideoLow":"http://player.vimeo.com/external/104231528.sd.mp4?s=3eb44e2d68b9f71e0363d9047e4b9e80e8606da7&profile_id=112&oauth2_token_id=20985841","OgvVideo":"","Speakers":[{"name":"Heather Rainey","slug":"heather-rainey"}],"Groups":[{"name":"AgileDotNext","slug":"agiledotnext"}],"Tags":[{"name":"Scrum","slug":"scrum"}]},{"Title":"BEYOND REMOVING IMPEDIMENTS - SCRUM MASTER AS TEAM COACH","Url":"https://usergroup.tv/videos/beyond-removing-impediments-scrum-master-as-team-coach/","Thumbnail":"https://i.vimeocdn.com/video/486708877_295x166.jpg","Excerpt":"<p>The role of the Scrum Master is about more than removing impediments and facilitating meetings.

Many agile teams write stories and rely completely on conversations about those stories for elaboration. This can be problematic when building complex systems. Often, underlying business rules are difficult to communicate clearly and accurately, and a bridge is needed between the story and acceptance criteria. Additionally, understanding team members’ different learning styles can help determine the best practices for describing requirements on a team.</p>\r\n<p>This session will provide a description of key skills and tools that skillful BA’s often use.

For those circumstances when you need server side rendering on your ASP.NET, there’s a relatively unknown but incredibly powerful open source library called HtmlTags. In this talk, we’ll review how to install HtmlTags in ASP.NET Core and go over the different categories of HtmlTags objects (Displays, Labels, Editors, etc.) available to you. From there we’ll start to unlock the real power by showing how to combine tag objects to build up standardized methods to render your forms in a consistent way across the application, alleviating the pain of copy and pasted layout across your HTML files. Imagine being able to change whether your labels and inputs are horizontal or vertical, or how date fields get rendered across the entire application by updating a single method! We’ll also dive into other practical techniques not in the documentation, such as easily customizing how your select lists are populated. The documentation for HtmlTags is almost nonexistent, so this walkthrough will be invaluable if you’re interested. HtmlTags can also be applied on a per-page basis, so you can start using it today without converting your entire application!","PostDate":"2020-11-09T00:00:00","Id":1043,"Mp4Video":"http://player.vimeo.com/external/478979187.hd.mp4?s=006565d5182acf9bd6415dc0348eccdf96ceaea2&profile_id=175&oauth2_token_id=20985841","Mp4VideoLow":"http://player.vimeo.com/external/478979187.sd.mp4?s=4aa5971fe2235a53a1c0df87d58d3cc8bfa4f75f&profile_id=165&oauth2_token_id=20985841","OgvVideo":"","Speakers":[{"name":"Nolan Egly","slug":"nolan-egly"}],"Groups":[{"name":"Austin .NET UG","slug":"austin-net-ug"}],"Tags":[{"name":"ASP.NET MVC","slug":"asp-net-mvc"},{"name":"ASP.NET","slug":"asp-net"},{"name":"HtmlTags","slug":"htmltags"}]},{"Title":"How Power Query Thinks: Taking the Mystery Out of Streaming and Query Folding","Url":"https://usergroup.tv/videos/how-power-query-thinks-taking-the-mystery-out-of-streaming-and-query-folding/","Thumbnail":"https://i.vimeocdn.com/video/994397461_295x166.jpg","Excerpt":"When a mashup is executed, sometimes the engine pulls rows one at a time (streaming). Other times, it translated a portion of the expression into the data source’s native query language (e.g. SQL) then offload its processing to that source (query folding). These behaviors affect execution efficiency (speed, memory usage, etc.), result accuracy (such as whether two aggregations returned by the same mashup are computed from the exact same data set) and data privacy/cross-source data sharing (think: privacy levels).
