                    <div><p>Reese Schmit is an Agile Coach at Agile Velocity. Over that past 15 years, she's worked her way around just about every side of software development, from User Experience Designer to Product Manager, QA Engineer to Scrum Master. The knowledge gained from each of these roles allows her to frame problems from different perspectives and foster change through empathy. As an Agile Coach, she has worked to help organizations drive customer value, transparency, and collaboration and to motivate teams to continuously improve. When she's not coaching, Reese is helping to run the Agile Austin Monthly Meeting or building the program for Scrum Gathering 2019. When she's not doing that, she is either chasing her tiny human girl or two canine boys around, hanging with her amazing husband, brewing beer, or, if by some miracle she gets to sit down, knitting.
