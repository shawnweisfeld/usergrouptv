One of the most interesting mobile technologies evolving today is Augmented Reality ? a technology that literally wasn't practically possible until we could shrink a video camera, a touch screen, a GPS, accelerometers, wireless networking, and serious graphical and general computing power into a palm sized consumer electronic device. Augmented Reality is enabling software developers to build engaging immersive apps that connect users with their physical surroundings in new and exciting ways by integrating a variety of data into the physical world through the magic of their mobile phone.
