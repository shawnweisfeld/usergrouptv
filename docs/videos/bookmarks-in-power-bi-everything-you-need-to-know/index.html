I know that bookmarks can be a bit overwhelming sometimes… Understanding all the different options and tricks you can use to create awesome reports, and especially managing and updating bookmarks can seem like a task that came directly from Mission Impossible.
In this session, I will go through all the ins and outs of creating bookmarks, and how you can use different bookmark combinations to create awesome reporting solutions that not only look good, but that also significantly improve user experience. And if you’re thinking “creating bookmarks is not a problem, the problem is updating them”, worry not!
