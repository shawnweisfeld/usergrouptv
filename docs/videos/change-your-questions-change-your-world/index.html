        <h2>Abstract: </h2>
        <div><p>Change Your Questions – Change Your World! Allison Pollard and Cherie Silas At a critical moment in history the world pivoted because people began to look at things from a different perspective. They stopped asking themselves, “How do we get to the water?” and started asking themselves, “How do we get the water to us?” When we change our questions we get entirely different outcomes. Questions are powerful tools in the hands of agile teams that can help people discover innovative solutions that have been locked inside waiting to be released into our products! Join us for a high-energy workshop that teaches how questions can be used to help a team learn, grow, and break through thought barriers. Learn what makes certain questions provoke more thought than others and how to make your questions more impactful. Participants in this session will discover how to change the way they currently communicate to incorporate powerful questions that will unlock new thinking patterns in their teams. They will also interactively learn how to identify if the way questions are being asked are actually impacting others in the manner intended.</p></div>

My goal is to invest the experience and talents I have gathered through years of learning, often times the hard way, into people whom I hope will become greater than I can ever dream to be. I believe in servant leadership which is all about finding joy in setting your personal aspirations aside and giving people what they need to grow and experience success. Ultimately, watching people accomplish things that they never believed possible and seeing them become who they never believed they could be fulfills every need I have for success in my life.
