        <h2>Abstract: </h2>
        <div><p>A free, unbiased look at the current and future development</p>

<p>The industry is in a state of flux. What does that mean for your software projects today and tomorrow? Will your skills be outdated? Will your current investment become obsolete? What should you focus on right now? And what will become important a year or two down the road? What technologies do you need to learn?</p>

<p>This series of free State of .NET events attempts to answer these questions and more, by taking an unbiased look at current and future development with .NET and other relevant technologies.</p>

<p>Join Markus Egger, Microsoft RD and one of the longest running MVPs for an afternoon of free information. CODE/EPS is in a unique position to share information based on real world experience in projects that are either our own or one of the many projects we get to see in our role as mentors, trainers and consultants, as well as feedback we receive from CODE Magazine readers. This is NOT marketing hype! We will tell you which technologies you should invest time and money in, and which ones to avoid.</p>

<p>This event is completely free of charge and is designed for developers as well as IT decision makers. Specific prior knowledge is not required. Attendees of this event will come away with a clear understanding of which technologies to use for various technical challenges.</p>

<p>Topics Include:
<ol>
<li>What’s new and useful in the world of .NET? What’s .NET’s role (and Microsoft’s role) in a modern world of development? The new approach, and more!</li>
<li>Visual Studio vNext</li>
<li>The dramatically new world of ASP.NET vNext</li>
<li>NuGet</li>
<li>Roslyn (and other compiler news)</li>
