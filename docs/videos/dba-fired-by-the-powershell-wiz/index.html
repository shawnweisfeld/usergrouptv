        <div><p>DBA work usually means you touch many different severs, and you do many mundane tasks. Your main tool for performing work is SSMS. You know all the keyboard shortcuts, which drilldown dialog box has which parameter, and you've got a long list of t-sql script templates to pull out the information you need.</p>
<p>But all of that takes time. There is still a lot of mouse clicking in SSMS. Many times you need to copy data out to further massage it to create a report.</p>
<p>Take a look at some of the great things you can do with PowerShell as a scripting language to let you access settings and make changes. You can make custom changes to your investigative queries much faster with a scripting language than t-sql. PowerShell's object-oriented nature allows for compact code. Learning to use PowerShell to manage SQL Server can save you large amount of time.
</p>
<p>This will go over the PowerShell module SqlServer (the replacement of SqlPs) and the benefits of a scripting language.</p>
<p>This will not use DbaTools.io, since that amazing tool deserves its own presentation.</p>
<p>Installing the module SqlServer will not be include. There are many tutorials on how to do this, and there are also a wide range of possible strange issues that are annoying to cover when they don't pertain to you.</p>
