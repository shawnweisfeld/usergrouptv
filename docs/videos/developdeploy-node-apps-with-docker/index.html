Kelly has been tinkering with computers for over 30 years, using BASIC for the first time at the prime age of 5.It wasn't until building his first webpage in 1997, and trying out JavaScript for the first time that he found a true calling. Kelly now fights for JavaScript, testable code, and fast delivery.In his free time you can find him singing karaoke, performing magic, or cheering for the Fighting Irish.
