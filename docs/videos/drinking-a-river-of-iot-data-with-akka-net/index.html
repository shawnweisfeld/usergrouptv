        <div><p>You can’t develop a device anymore without it connecting to something. These ‘smart’ devices all have one thing in common: they generate a never-ending stream of data. If you want to process all that data for 100, 1000, or 10000 devices, you can probably get by with a very simple web stack. But as soon as you want to scale to 1000000 or more devices, you’re going to need a better strategy. Scaling software is always tricky. We all have been through this. You load balance your web farm only to find out that your database is a bottleneck. Or to find out you need to synchronize caches across your farm. Akka.NET and its implementation of the actor model make scaling a bit easier. Developing a highly concurrent stateful system becomes a breeze. And it's just as easy to scale it out and to make it resilient. But obviously there are pitfalls as well. No prior Akka.NET knowledge is required.</p></div>

                    <div><p>Hannes is a developer, a coach, and a father of 3. In his role as a .NET consultant at Axxes, he likes performance, databases, distributed systems, and large scale apps. But most of all, he likes playing devil’s advocate in technical discussions by playing the ‘it depends’ card. In his free time, when he’s not building LEGO® castles with his kids, he likes to spend time building guitars, playing chess & poker, tasting whiskey and doing all round geeky stuff. You can occasionally find him on an afterparty stage at PubConf or with Dylan Beattie & the Linebreakers.</p></div>
