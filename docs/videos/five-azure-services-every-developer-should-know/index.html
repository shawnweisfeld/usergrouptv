        <h2>Abstract: </h2>
        <div>Getting started with Azure can be daunting for new developers. With dozens of various platforms, it's easy to become overwhelmed with choices! Where should I host my applications? Where should I store my data? How do I manage my applications? Despite the broad number of services, it is possible to narrow down to a handful of platforms that meet many of the most common application requirements and is also a great place to get started learning more about Azure. In this talk, I'll introduce you to five of these platforms, how to work with them, alongside some best practices. Along the way, we'll implement and deploy a solution to Azure that takes advantage of them.</div>

                    <div>Joshua Carlisle, Principal Cloud Engineer on the CSPM team at Zscaler <br /> I work with organizations to help realize the full potential for technology. As a trusted advisor I help executive and technology decision-makers with some of their hardest decisions and have delivered on some of the most demanding challenges. As a technical manager, I have built and grown very successful technical teams. As an engineer and architect, I’ve worked extensively with Microsoft enterprise technology stacks from my early professional days in the 90s working with C++ and Visual Basic, to the birth of .Net, to the extraordinary growth of the cloud and Microsoft Azure today. I have extensive experience designing, architecting, and building cloud native applications on Azure and helping organizations realize the full potential of the Azure Cloud Platform. I have a special focus area of Serverless Platforms, especially Azure Functions. <br /> I have also been engaging with the technology community for most of my career and can be found speaking at conferences and community events throughout the country. I’m a Microsoft MVP in Azure and also help co-organize various technology meetups including the Triangle .Net Usergroup, Triangle Serverless Meetup, and other Raleigh and regional technology organizations.</div>
