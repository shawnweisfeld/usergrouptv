        <h2>Abstract: </h2>
        <div>We all want to use Cloud in our projects, and every customer I talk to has developers that want to pioneer their company's adoption of the latest and coolest stuff. But for every success story there is a painful admission: Crazy costs from unconstrained adoption; sensitive data suddenly stored somewhere it shouldn't be; technology gone wild as every project tries something new. The solution is governance, and making sure you, the developers and IT Pros who are advocating cloud in you organisations understand the management needed for successful adoption is key: When you convince your team to move to Azure you can get extra credit for helping your organisation move to the cloud without the pain. Whilst governance does not need tooling per se, Microsoft has a range of great tools in the Azure arsenal to help you. In this session I'll talk about the kinds of things that can go wrong, the simple things you can do to avoid them

</div>
                    <div>Rik Hepworth Chief Consulting Office, Black Marble; Microsoft MVP (Azure); Microsoft Regional Director As Chief Consulting Officer at Black Marble, Rik helps organisations large and small use Cloud better. Whether that is a new adoption where governance and management are key, or an application modernisation project where technology choice and team knowledge are important factors in success. Through his public speaking and community involvement, Rik is a recipient of the Microsoft MVP Programme award for his work with Azure. He is also proud to be a member of the Microsoft Regional Director Programme. As an event organiser, speaker and lapsed blogger, Rik is keen to share his knowledge with the community, and encourage and support others as they do the same. His grey hair is an indication of how long he has worked in IT, and in that time he's done most things you'd expect of an IT Pro: From crawling under floors pulling cables, to managing large scale automated OS rollouts, to architecting solutions for on-premises and cloud. Now he spends more time working with his customers' management, sharing that breadth of experience and learning.</div>
