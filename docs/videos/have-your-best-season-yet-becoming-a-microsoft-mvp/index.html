                    <div><p>Lisa Anderson is Microsoft’s US Central Region Community Program Manager – responsible for the Microsoft Most Valuable Professionals Program (MVP) and Regional Directors Program in the Central United States (all of the states in between the coasts). In her previous role at Microsoft, Lisa worked in the Microsoft Services group as a Technical Account Manager responsible for managing Premier Services account portfolios for several enterprise customers in the legal and commercial real estate industries. In her four years at Microsoft, Lisa has also been a community leader for Microsoft’s MACH program (Microsoft Academy of College Hires) and assists in recruitment and interviewing efforts for university hires all over the USA. Lisa attended the University of Wisconsin-Madison (Go Badgers!) and earned a BA in psychology. She aims to combine her background and passion for psychology to help people in the tech industry do their best work and lead their most fulfilling and balanced lives. She can be found at technical conferences speaking about how positive leadership strategies can help leaders and community members become more successful and productive. Outside of work, Lisa enjoys traveling (she has visited 13 countries outside the US so far and always planning her next trip!). When not on the move, she enjoys a nice brandy Old Fashioned and Wisconsin Fish Fry back at her parents’ home in Wausau, WI. Her other interests include cooking, hiking, skiing, and petting cats.</p></div>
