Microsoft has made implementing parent-child relationships faster and simpler to implement successfully through the new native support of hierarchical data in SQL Server 2008.

Initial setup and configuration of the HierarchyID data type can seem tricky and confusing at first. Especially with real work situations like having multiple root nodes or both branch and root nodes simultaneously. In this demonstration I will setup and implement standard node branching as well as Multi-root and tree branch\/root combinations for advanced hierarchical data scenarios.
