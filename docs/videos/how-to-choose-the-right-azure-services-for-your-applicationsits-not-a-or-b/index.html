    How to Choose the Right Azure Services for Your Applications—It’s Not A or B &ndash; UserGroup.tv

<meta name="description" content="As you move to the cloud, an important decision you’ll make is which Azure service to use to host your applications. People often see this as an A or B choice. For example, you might ask, “Should we use Azure Kubernetes Service (AKS) or Azure App Service to host all our applications?”

This A or B mindset comes from traditional, on-premises practices, in which building and deploying an application platform required big upfront investments and long lead times. With Azure, you provision and deprovision resources as needed, so you don’t have to make a single choice between A or B. It’s easy and more cost-effective to shift to a modular, A&#43;B approach. You choose the right tool for each job, without being limited to one service to host all your applications.

Hear from the authors of the e-book How to Choose the Right Azure Services for Your Applications—It’s Not A or B to learn how to:

Apply the principles of an A&#43;B mindset to select the best Azure service to meet each of your application needs.
Take a modular approach to migrating an on-premises application to Azure.
Modernize your applications more quickly and smoothly, and at scale.

        <h2>Abstract: </h2>
        <div>As you move to the cloud, an important decision you’ll make is which Azure service to use to host your applications. People often see this as an A or B choice. For example, you might ask, “Should we use Azure Kubernetes Service (AKS) or Azure App Service to host all our applications?”

This A or B mindset comes from traditional, on-premises practices, in which building and deploying an application platform required big upfront investments and long lead times. With Azure, you provision and deprovision resources as needed, so you don’t have to make a single choice between A or B. It’s easy and more cost-effective to shift to a modular, A+B approach. You choose the right tool for each job, without being limited to one service to host all your applications.

Hear from the authors of the e-book How to Choose the Right Azure Services for Your Applications—It’s Not A or B to learn how to:

Apply the principles of an A+B mindset to select the best Azure service to meet each of your application needs.
Take a modular approach to migrating an on-premises application to Azure.
Modernize your applications more quickly and smoothly, and at scale.
