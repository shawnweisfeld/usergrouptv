In this talk, we’ll review how to install HtmlTags in ASP.NET Core and go over the different categories of HtmlTags objects (Displays, Labels, Editors, etc.) available to you. From there we’ll start to unlock the real power by showing how to combine tag objects to build up standardized methods to render your forms in a consistent way across the application, alleviating the pain of copy and pasted layout across your HTML files.
