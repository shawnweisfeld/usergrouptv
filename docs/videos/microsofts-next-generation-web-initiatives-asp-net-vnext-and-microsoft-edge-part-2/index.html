        <h2>Abstract: </h2>
        <div><p>It is no secret that the Web is of considerable importance to Microsoft. Areas of interest range from Cloud-based back-ends to client-side technologies. Recently, Microsoft has introduced two major new initiatives of considerable importance to all Web Developers: ASP.NET vNext for development of HTML-based applications, and Microsoft Edge, as a replacement for the previous Internet Explorer browser. Both technologies are expected to have a major impact on the day-to-day lives of Web Developers. 

</p>
<p>ASP.NET has long been a cornerstone for server-side components for all Microsoft-based web developers. In the latest incarnation, Microsoft has completely re-written ASP.NET in an effort to re-boot the platform for the next-generation Web. This has been done to support modern web development paradigms and requirements. The new version is more suitable for Cloud-operation, while still maintaining great support for on premise deployment. ASP.NET vNext supports cross platform operation, for those who prefer a Linux server platform. The new version also focusses on enhanced support for HTML5 technologies and things such as JavaScript, frameworks, build automation, and more.
