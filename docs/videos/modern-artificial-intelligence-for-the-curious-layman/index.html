He began his career in the trial-by-fire world of NYC startups building Natural Language Processing tools for document categorization and recognition, before moving down to Austin for a more stable life as a Consultant for Headspring building custom applications for a variety of clients and domains.  At work Patrick codes smart, sustainable websites, while at home he experiments with cutting-edge Machine Learning algorithms in what is definitely not an attempt to build Skynet.</p></div>
