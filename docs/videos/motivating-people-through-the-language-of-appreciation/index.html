        <h2>Abstract: </h2>
        <div><p>Agile leaders want to build projects around motivated people, give them the environment and support they need, and trust them to get the job done. Understanding the power of appreciation languages and how the people react to the regular use (or lack of use) of these languages in the workplace can be a key component to creating a culture and environment filled with motivated individuals who feel valued and supported. This information can help leaders to resolve performance problems, build trust and transparency, increase collaboration and creativity, and improve retention rates. Using appreciation languages as a motivational tool and teaching others in the organization to speak these languages fluently leads to positive results because people who feel appreciated also feel valued, safe, creative, dedicated, motivated and able to accomplish anything. Therefore properly applying the languages of appreciation can be powerful skill that leaders can bring into their organizations in order to help high performing teams begin to emerge.</p>
<p>*Five Appreciation Languages?: Words of Affirmation, ?Quality Time, ?Acts of Service?, Tangible Gifts, ?Physical Contact</p>
<p>This presentation will describe the five appreciation languages and talk about effective ways to use them with individuals in the workplace as motivators using real life success stories as examples. Attendees will be given the opportunity to take a short assessment to determine what their primary and secondary appreciation language is and will do a team based exercise to determine methods for identifying ideas for ways to implement the language of appreciation into their workplace.</p></div>
