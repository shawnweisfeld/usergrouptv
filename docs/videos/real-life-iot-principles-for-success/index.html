        <h2>Abstract: </h2>
        <div><p>Elyxor has worked through some real-life IoT projects to transform business processes in the Industrial IoT (often called M2M) space. As the industry matures, it is becoming more clear that well designed business and technology IoT architectures can result in (1) elimination of process waste resulting in saved time and cost, (2) improved data insights to your business, (3) changing experiences for individuals interacting with a business process, and (4) changing how we communicate with customers. These results sound great, but along this journey and various engagements, we have learned some principles that are needed to make such a project or transformation successful. The discussion is to share these concepts so that your future projects contemplate these items and take the best first step toward a successful IoT solution construction effort. In our presentation, we will support this discussion with some real-life stories and experiences to provide context. In our role of IoT system integrators and business consultants, we have been able to solve problems in various industries and with different tech stacks.</p></div>
