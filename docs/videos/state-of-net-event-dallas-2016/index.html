        <h2>Abstract: </h2>
        <div><p>Brought to you by CODE Consulting and CODE Magazine, these free events are designed for developers and IT decision makers. Join Markus Egger, Microsoft RD and one of the longest running MVPs, for this free event. This is NOT marketing hype! We will discuss which technologies are worth investing time and money in, and which ones to avoid. </p>
<p>The software industry is in a state of flux. What does that mean for your software projects today and tomorrow? Will your skills be outdated? Will your current investment become obsolete? Which technologies should you focus on right now? And what will become important a year or two down the road? These free events will answer these questions and more, by taking an unbiased look at current and future software development. </p>
<p>This event is completely free and prior knowledge is not required. Attendees will come away with a clear understanding of which technologies to use for various technical challenges and which ones are better to avoid. </p>
