        <div>CALCULATE and Time Intelligence functions have long been considered cornerstones of DAX. However, recent thinking spurred by MS MVP Greg Deckler posits that DAX is better off without either of these. Brian Julius and Mike Ford will discuss their experience completing Curbal's two "25 Days of DAX" exercises under these constraints. They will address issues including ease of measure creation, transparency and maintenance, performance, learning curve, and automation considerations.</div>

</div>
                    <div>Brian holds a B.A. in Economics and a M.S. in Public Policy and Management, both heavily focused on econometrics and other quantitative methods. After beginning his career in economic consulting, he worked 30+ years for the U.S. Federal government, in a variety of data-driven roles, as well as in a number of executive/senior management positions. Since 2019, he has focused primarily on Power BI development, implementation and training, first serving as Project Manager on his agency's first large-scale implementation of Power BI. After retiring from the government in 2021, he began working full-time as the Enterprise DNA Chief Content Officer overseeing the creation of all free and member-only technical content, and continuing to serve as an expert and content creator myself. Brian lives in Washington, DC with my wife Sue and two charming, but ill-behaved cats who often can be seen and heard interrupting his YouTube videos.</div>
