        <h2>Abstract: </h2>
        <div>There is an ever-increasing need for companies to handle "Big Data". The application of big data varies based on the needs of customers. Some companies have some need for processing small amounts of unstructured data while other companies exist to process extremely large amounts of data. What does "Big Data" actually mean and how does it apply to you? In this talk, we'll cover "Big Data" and various Azure tools and solutions for processing data. Extract, Transform, Load (ETL) is just the tip of the iceberg of needs customers have. You'll see how ETL tools like Azure Data Factory can help you work with data migration and exporting. We will also cover storage options and techniques using Azure Synapse and "Data Lakes". We'll also discuss using techniques that can improve data processing which in turn supports the needs of analytics.</div>
