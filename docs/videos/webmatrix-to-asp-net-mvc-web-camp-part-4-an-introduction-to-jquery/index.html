                    <div><p>Brandon Satrom is a Developer Evangelist for Microsoft, based in Austin, TX. He has eleven years of industry experience, splitting his time evenly between consulting/service organizations and internal IT shops before joining Microsoft in June of 2010. A Software and Enterprise Architect, Brandon has worked on projects of all shapes for companies large and small, most recently using technologies such as Windows Communication Foundation (WCF), Windows Workflow Foundation (WF) and ASP.NET MVC with a healthy dose of OSS. Brandon loves writing and speaking, and has written articles for The Architecture Journal and MSDN Magazine. He lives in Austin with his wife and son, blogs about software architecture and development at http://www.userinexperience.com and can be found on Twitter at @BrandonSatrom.</p>
<p>Clark Sell is a Developer Evangelist for Microsoft. Name a role in the software industry, and Clark has probably played it. He started as a Y2K tester and has since worked as a developer, lead, "build monkey", solutions architect and product manager. His professional sweet spot however, lies in designing and building software solutions that make life easier - there&rsquo;s no chance for boredom and constant opportunities for growth. Clark is MCSD certified and received top Microsoft honors with the Circle of Excellence Award. He&rsquo;s a graduate of Western Illinois University and before joining Microsoft in 2005, he served as a solutions architect at Allstate Insurance Company. As a senior developer evangelist and Visual Studio team system ranger, Clark brings a good dose of humor and a zest for life to the podium. You can hear Clark&rsquo;s technical musings on "The Smackdown" at DeveloperSmackdown.com and The Thirsty Developer Podcast - or find him getting grease under his nails in the garage. Clark&rsquo;s a muscle car fanatic who&rsquo;s currently finishing a body-off restoration of his 1970 Chevrolet Camaro while driving his 1968 Camaro SS.</p></div>
