He currently works as an independent performance DBA/Developer for clients across the USA and Canada. He started his career as a database developer, but over time became more and more interested in how the database engine operated ... eventually becoming more focused on operational and performance issues than code.Rick will work with all things relational, but most enjoys helping smaller companies get better performance from MSSQL, as well as smoothing over relationships between DBA and development teams.</p></div>
