His goal is to always exceed client expectations, solve business problems. and turn the unimaginable into what is real and valuable. At GAP, he has led hundreds of projects including the development of mobile and cloud-based applications geared for healthcare, consumer, and business-to-business users. He reiterates that app dev does not have to be chaotic or costly, as proven by GAP's success and client roster. Before joining GAP, Paul served as product line director for BMC Software, where he established world-class processes in outsourcing and Agile Scrum development for teams in the United States and around the globe. Under Paul's leadership, his teams achieved double-digit revenue growth and the company's highest customer satisfaction ratings.

One is College Forward, a non-profit college coaching program that offers one-on-one support to students, eleventh grade through college graduation. Another is The Next to New Shop, a charitable consignment shop. Paul enjoys playing video games, riding motorcycles, and pursuing martial arts with his son. He's also a skydiving enthusiast with more than 350 jumps to date.</p></div>
